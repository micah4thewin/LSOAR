They provide a way to encapsulate a set of instructions and execute them whenever needed. In this article, we will explore functions and methods in depth, discussing their purpose, syntax, and usage.\n\n## Key Terms\n- Function: A reusable block of code that performs a specific task.\n- Method: A function that belongs to an object or a class.\n- Encapsulation: The process of bundling data and methods together into a single unit.\n- Parameters: Variables defined in a function or method that receive values when the function is called.\n- Return Value: The value that a function or method sends back to the caller.\n\n## Detailed Explanation\nFunctions and methods play a crucial role in programming by promoting code reusability and modularity. They allow developers to break down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable pieces of code.\n\nA function is a self-contained block of code that performs a specific task. It can accept input parameters, process them, and optionally return a result. Functions can be defined and used independently, making them versatile and reusable.\n\nOn the other hand, a method is a function that belongs to a specific object or class. It operates on the data within the object and can access its properties and other methods. Methods enable object-oriented programming and are invoked through the object they belong to.\n\nBoth functions and methods have a similar syntax. They begin with a keyword, followed by an optional return type, a name, a set of parentheses for parameters, and a block of code enclosed in curly braces.\n\n```javascript\n// Function example\nfunction greet(name) {\n  return \"Hello, \" + name + \"!\";\n}\n\n// Method example\nclass Person {\n  constructor(name) {\n    this.name = name;\n  }\n\n  greet() {\n    return \"Hello, \" + this.name + \"!\";\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Concepts\n- Functions and methods are reusable blocks of code.\n- Functions can be independent, while methods belong to objects or classes.\n- Both functions and methods can accept parameters and return values.\n\n## Examples\nLet's explore some examples to better understand the usage of functions and methods:\n\n```javascript\n// Function example\nfunction calculateArea(radius) {\n  return Math.PI * radius * radius;\n}\n\nconst circleArea = calculateArea(5);\nconsole.log(circleArea); // Output: 78.53981633974483\n\n// Method example\nclass Rectangle {\n  constructor(width, height) {\n    this.width = width;\n    this.height = height;\n  }\n\n  calculateArea() {\n    return this.width * this.height;\n  }\n}\n\nconst rectangle = new Rectangle(4, 6);\nconst rectangleArea = rectangle.calculateArea();\nconsole.log(rectangleArea); // Output: 24\n```\n\nIn the above examples, we have a function `calculateArea` that calculates the area of a circle based on the given radius. We also have a method `calculateArea` within the `Rectangle` class that calculates the area of a rectangle using its width and height.\n\n## Tips for Understanding\n- Functions and methods are powerful tools for organizing and reusing code. Embrace their usage to improve the readability and maintainability of your programs.\n- When defining functions or methods, choose descriptive names that accurately reflect their purpose.\n- Understand the difference between functions and methods in object-oriented programming. Methods operate on the data within objects, while functions are independent.\n\n## Questions and Answers\n**Q: Can a function have multiple return statements?**\nA: Yes, a function can have multiple return statements. However, only one return statement will be executed when the function is called. Once a return statement is reached, the function terminates, and the value is sent back to the caller.\n\n**Q: Can a method access other methods within the same object?**\nA: Yes, a method can access other methods within the same object. Since methods belong to an object, they can access all the properties and methods of that object using the `this` keyword.\n\n## Facts\n- Functions and methods are fundamental concepts in programming, used in almost all programming languages.\n- By encapsulating code within functions and methods, developers can achieve code reusability, modularity, and maintainability.\n- Functions and methods are building blocks for implementing algorithms and solving complex problems.\n\n## Summary Points\n- Functions and methods are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks.\n- Functions can be independent, while methods belong to objects or classes.\n- Both functions and methods can accept parameters and return values.\n- Functions and methods promote code reusability and modularity.\n- Methods can access other methods and properties within the same object using the `this` keyword."
