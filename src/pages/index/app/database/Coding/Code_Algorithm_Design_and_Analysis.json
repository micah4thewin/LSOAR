It involves understanding how to solve problems using algorithms and evaluating their efficiency in terms of time and space complexity.\n\n## Key Terms\n- Algorithm: A step-by-step procedure or set of rules to solve a specific problem.\n- Code: The implementation of an algorithm in a programming language.\n- Design: The process of creating an algorithm that solves a particular problem efficiently.\n- Analysis: Evaluating the efficiency and performance of an algorithm.\n\n## Detailed Explanation\nCode Algorithm Design and Analysis is essential in computer science as it allows programmers to create efficient and optimized solutions to problems. It involves understanding the problem, designing an algorithm to solve it, implementing the algorithm in code, and analyzing its performance.\n\nWhen designing an algorithm, it is important to consider factors such as the input size, expected output, and any constraints or requirements. The algorithm should be designed to handle different scenarios and provide the correct solution.\n\nOnce the algorithm is designed, it needs to be implemented in code. This involves writing the necessary code in a programming language such as JavaScript. The code should accurately reflect the steps and logic of the algorithm.\n\nAfter implementation, the next step is to analyze the algorithm's performance. This involves evaluating its time complexity, which measures how the algorithm's execution time grows with input size. It also involves analyzing the space complexity, which measures the amount of memory the algorithm requires.\n\nEfficient algorithms have low time and space complexity, meaning they can solve problems quickly and with minimal memory usage.
