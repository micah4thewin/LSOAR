D2C refers to the practice of selling products directly to customers, bypassing traditional retail intermediaries. This approach allows businesses to have greater control over their brand, customer experience, and profit margins. In this article, we will explore the fundamentals of D2C strategies and their importance in the eCommerce landscape.\n\n## Business Background\nThe rise of D2C strategies can be attributed to the rapid growth of eCommerce and technological advancements.

This allows customers to easily find and navigate your online store.\n\n2. **Personalized Customer Experience**: Tailoring the shopping experience to individual customers' preferences and needs can enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty. Leveraging customer data and implementing personalized marketing campaigns are key to achieving this.\n\n3. **Streamlined Supply Chain**: D2C businesses often handle their own fulfillment and logistics.
