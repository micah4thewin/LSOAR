It belongs to a class of drugs known as beta blockers, which work by blocking the effects of adrenaline on the heart. This helps to reduce the workload on the heart and lower blood pressure.\n\n## Medication Overview\nMetoprolol is available in different formulations, including immediate-release tablets, extended-release tablets, and intravenous injection. The medication is selective for beta-1 receptors, primarily found in the heart, and has little effect on beta-2 receptors in the lungs.\n\n## Uses and Benefits\nMetoprolol is commonly prescribed for the following conditions and situations:\n\n- Hypertension (high blood pressure)\n- Angina (chest pain)\n- Heart failure\n- Arrhythmias (irregular heart rhythms)\n- Myocardial infarction (heart attack)\n- Migraine prevention\n- Hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid)\n\nThe benefits of metoprolol include:\n\n- Reducing blood pressure\n- Improving heart function\n- Preventing chest pain\n- Controlling heart rate\n- Reducing the risk of future heart attacks\n\n## Dosage and Administration\nThe dosage of metoprolol will vary depending on the individual's condition and response to treatment.
