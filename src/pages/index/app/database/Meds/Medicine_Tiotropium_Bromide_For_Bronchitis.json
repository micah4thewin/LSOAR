Common side effects may include dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention, blurred vision, and throat irritation. These side effects are usually mild and temporary.\n\nIn rare cases, Tiotropium Bromide may cause more serious side effects such as allergic reactions, rapid heartbeat, or difficulty urinating. If you experience any unusual or severe symptoms, it is important to seek medical attention immediately.\n\nBefore using Tiotropium Bromide, inform your healthcare provider about any existing medical conditions, allergies, or medications you are currently taking. It is especially important to mention if you have narrow-angle glaucoma, an enlarged prostate, or a history of urinary retention.\n\n## Interactions\n\nTiotropium Bromide may interact with other medications, including anticholinergic drugs, beta-blockers, and diuretics. These interactions can affect the effectiveness or safety of the medication. It is important to inform your healthcare provider about all the medications you are taking to avoid potential interactions.\n\n## Patient Considerations\n\n- Tiotropium Bromide is not recommended for use in children under the age of 6.\n- Pregnant or breastfeeding women should consult their healthcare provider before using Tiotropium Bromide.\n- It is important to use Tiotropium Bromide regularly as prescribed, even if you are not experiencing symptoms.\n- If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember.
