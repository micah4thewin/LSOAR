It belongs to a class of drugs known as 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors.\n\n## Medication Overview\nFinasteride works by inhibiting the enzyme 5-alpha-reductase, which converts testosterone into dihydrotestosterone (DHT). DHT is responsible for hair follicle miniaturization in male pattern hair loss and contributes to the growth of the prostate gland in BPH. By reducing DHT levels, finasteride helps to reverse hair loss and reduce the size of the prostate gland.\n\n## Uses and Benefits\n1. Male Pattern Hair Loss: Finasteride is FDA-approved for the treatment of male pattern hair loss, also known as androgenetic alopecia. It helps to regrow hair and prevent further hair loss in men with this condition.\n2. Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia: Finasteride is also used to treat BPH, a non-cancerous enlargement of the prostate gland. It can improve urinary symptoms such as frequent urination, weak urine flow, and difficulty starting and stopping urination.\n\n## Dosage and Administration\n1. Male Pattern Hair Loss: The recommended dosage of finasteride for male pattern hair loss is 1 mg per day. It is usually taken orally as a single tablet.\n2. Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia: The recommended dosage of finasteride for BPH is 5 mg per day. It is also taken orally as a single tablet.\n\n## Side Effects and Precautions\n1. Side Effects: Common side effects of finasteride include decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, and decreased ejaculate volume. These side effects are usually reversible upon discontinuation of the medication. Rarely, finasteride may cause breast tenderness or enlargement, which should be reported to a healthcare professional.\n2. Precautions: Finasteride should not be handled by pregnant women, as it can be absorbed through the skin and cause harm to a developing fetus. It is important to use barrier methods of contraception if engaging in sexual activity with a pregnant partner or to avoid contact with crushed or broken tablets.\n\n## Interactions\nFinasteride does not have any significant drug interactions. However, it is always important to inform your healthcare provider about all the medications, supplements, and herbal products you are taking to ensure safe and effective use of finasteride.\n\n## Patient Considerations\n1. Male Pattern Hair Loss: Finasteride is only approved for use in men. It is not recommended for use in women or children.\n2. Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia: Finasteride can take several months to show its full effect in BPH. It is important to continue taking the medication as prescribed and follow up with a healthcare professional regularly.\n\n## Summary\nFinasteride is a medication used for the treatment of male pattern hair loss and benign prostatic hyperplasia. It works by reducing DHT levels, which helps to reverse hair loss and reduce the size of the prostate gland. Common side effects include decreased libido and erectile dysfunction. It is important to follow the recommended dosage and precautions, and to inform your healthcare provider about any medications you are taking."
