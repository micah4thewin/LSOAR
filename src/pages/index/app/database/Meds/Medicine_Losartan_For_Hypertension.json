  "article": "## Introduction\n\nLosartan is a medication commonly used to treat hypertension, also known as high blood pressure. It belongs to a class of drugs called angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). Losartan works by blocking the action of a hormone called angiotensin II, which causes blood vessels to narrow and blood pressure to increase. By blocking the effects of angiotensin II, losartan helps to relax and widen blood vessels, reducing blood pressure.\n\n## Medication Overview\n\nLosartan is available in tablet form and is typically taken once daily. It is available in various strengths, ranging from 25 mg to 100 mg. The medication is usually prescribed by a healthcare professional and should be taken as directed. It can be taken with or without food.\n\n## Uses and Benefits\n\nThe primary use of losartan is to treat hypertension. It can be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive medications. Losartan may also be prescribed to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy (enlarged heart). Additionally, it may be used to treat diabetic nephropathy (kidney disease) in patients with type 2 diabetes.\n\nLosartan has been shown to effectively lower blood pressure and reduce the risk of cardiovascular events, such as heart attack and stroke. It is well-tolerated by most patients and has a low incidence of side effects.\n\n## Dosage and Administration\n\nThe recommended starting dose of losartan for hypertension is usually 50 mg once daily. Depending on the patient's response, the dosage may be increased to a maximum of 100 mg once daily. For patients with diabetic nephropathy, the recommended starting dose is 50 mg once daily, which may be increased to 100 mg once daily.\n\nIt is important to follow the dosage instructions provided by the healthcare professional. If a dose is missed, it should be taken as soon as remembered, unless it is almost time for the next dose. In that case, the missed dose should be skipped and the regular dosing schedule should be resumed.\n\n## Side Effects and Precautions\n\nLike any medication, losartan may cause side effects in some patients. Common side effects include dizziness, headache, fatigue, and cough. These side effects are usually mild and temporary.\n\nIn rare cases, losartan may cause more serious side effects, such as allergic reactions, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat, and liver problems. If any of these side effects occur, medical attention should be sought immediately.\n\nLosartan should be used with caution in patients with kidney or liver problems, as well as in patients with a history of angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat). It may also interact with certain medications, so it is important to inform the healthcare professional about all other medications being taken.\n\n## Interactions\n\nLosartan may interact with certain medications, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), potassium supplements, and diuretics. These interactions may increase the risk of side effects or reduce the effectiveness of the medication. It is important to inform the healthcare professional about all medications being taken, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements.\n\n## Patient Considerations\n\nSpecial considerations should be taken for different patient groups when prescribing losartan. For pregnant women, losartan is generally not recommended, as it may cause harm to the fetus. It is important to discuss the potential risks and benefits with a healthcare professional.\n\nFor elderly patients, the starting dose of losartan may be lower, as they may be more susceptible to certain side effects, such as dizziness.\n\n## Summary\n\nLosartan is a medication commonly used to treat hypertension. It works by blocking the action of angiotensin II, a hormone that causes blood vessels to narrow and blood pressure to increase. Losartan is well-tolerated and has been shown to effectively lower blood pressure and reduce the risk of cardiovascular events. It may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive medications. It is important to follow the dosage instructions provided by the healthcare professional and to be aware of possible side effects and drug interactions. Special considerations should be taken for pregnant women and elderly patients."
