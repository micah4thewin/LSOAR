It belongs to a class of drugs called angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Lisinopril works by relaxing blood vessels, allowing blood to flow more easily and reducing the workload on the heart.\n\n## Medication Overview\nLisinopril is available in tablet form and is usually taken once a day. It is available in different strengths, ranging from 2.5 mg to 40 mg. The medication is typically prescribed by a healthcare professional and should be taken as directed.\n\n## Uses and Benefits\nLisinopril is primarily used to treat hypertension. It can help lower blood pressure and reduce the risk of complications associated with high blood pressure, such as heart attack and stroke. In addition to treating hypertension, lisinopril may also be prescribed for patients with heart failure or to improve survival rates after a heart attack.\n\n## Dosage and Administration\nThe dosage of lisinopril will vary depending on the individual's condition and response to the medication. It is important to follow the prescribed dosage instructions provided by the healthcare professional. Lisinopril is typically taken once a day, with or without food. It is important to take the medication at the same time each day to maintain consistent blood levels.\n\n## Side Effects and Precautions\nLike any medication, lisinopril may cause side effects. Common side effects include dizziness, headache, cough, and gastrointestinal disturbances. In rare cases, lisinopril can cause more serious side effects such as allergic reactions, kidney problems, or low blood pressure. It is important to seek medical attention if any severe or persistent side effects occur.\n\nBefore starting lisinopril, it is important to inform the healthcare professional about any existing medical conditions or allergies. Lisinopril may not be suitable for individuals with certain conditions, such as kidney disease or liver disease. It is also important to avoid alcohol while taking lisinopril, as it can increase the risk of side effects.\n\n## Interactions\nLisinopril may interact with other medications, including diuretics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and potassium supplements. These interactions can affect the effectiveness of lisinopril or increase the risk of side effects. It is important to inform the healthcare professional about all medications, supplements, and herbal products being taken to avoid potential interactions.\n\n## Patient Considerations\nSpecial considerations may be necessary for certain patient groups. For pregnant women or those planning to become pregnant, lisinopril is generally not recommended as it may harm the fetus. Breastfeeding women should also consult with their healthcare professional before taking lisinopril. Elderly patients may require a lower dosage of lisinopril due to age-related changes in kidney function.\n\n## Summary\nLisinopril is a medication commonly used to treat hypertension. It works by relaxing blood vessels and reducing blood pressure. The medication is generally well-tolerated, but it may cause side effects such as dizziness or cough. It is important to follow the prescribed dosage and inform the healthcare professional about any existing medical conditions or medications. Overall, lisinopril can be an effective treatment option for individuals with hypertension when used as directed by a healthcare professional."
