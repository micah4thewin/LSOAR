It belongs to a class of drugs called angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Enalapril works by relaxing blood vessels and reducing the workload on the heart, thereby lowering blood pressure.\n\n## Medication Overview\nEnalapril is available in tablet form and is typically taken once or twice daily. It is a prescription medication and should only be used under the guidance of a healthcare professional. Enalapril is available under various brand names, including Vasotec and Epaned.\n\n## Uses and Benefits\nEnalapril is primarily used for the treatment of hypertension. It is also prescribed for certain heart conditions, such as congestive heart failure and left ventricular dysfunction. Enalapril can help improve symptoms and reduce the risk of complications associated with these conditions.\n\n## Dosage and Administration\nThe dosage of enalapril may vary depending on the individual's condition and response to treatment. It is important to follow the dosage instructions provided by the healthcare professional. Enalapril tablets are usually taken orally with or without food. The medication should be taken at the same time each day to maintain consistent blood levels.\n\n## Side Effects and Precautions\nCommon side effects of enalapril may include dizziness, headache, cough, and fatigue. These side effects are usually mild and go away on their own. However, if they persist or worsen, it is important to inform the healthcare provider. In rare cases, enalapril may cause more serious side effects such as allergic reactions, swelling of the face or throat, and difficulty breathing. If any of these symptoms occur, immediate medical attention should be sought.\n\nIt is important to inform the healthcare provider about any pre-existing medical conditions or allergies before starting enalapril. Enalapril may not be suitable for individuals with a history of angioedema, kidney disease, or liver disease. It is also important to avoid alcohol and certain medications while taking enalapril, as they may interact and increase the risk of side effects.\n\n## Interactions\nEnalapril may interact with certain medications, including diuretics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and potassium supplements. These interactions can affect the effectiveness of enalapril or increase the risk of side effects. It is important to inform the healthcare provider about all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, before starting enalapril.\n\n## Patient Considerations\n- Pregnant or breastfeeding individuals should consult with their healthcare provider before taking enalapril, as it may cause harm to the fetus or nursing baby.\n- Enalapril may cause dizziness or lightheadedness, especially during the first few days of treatment. It is important to avoid activities that require alertness until the individual's response to the medication is known.\n- Elderly individuals may be more sensitive to the side effects of enalapril. Close monitoring is necessary to ensure the medication is well-tolerated.\n\n## Summary\nEnalapril is a medication used for the treatment of hypertension and certain heart conditions. It works by relaxing blood vessels and reducing blood pressure. Enalapril is generally well-tolerated, but it may cause side effects such as dizziness and cough. It is important to follow the dosage instructions and inform the healthcare provider about any pre-existing medical conditions or medications. Pregnant or breastfeeding individuals should consult with their healthcare provider before taking enalapril."
