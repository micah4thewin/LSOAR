Docker images are the building blocks of containers, and they can be signed and verified to ensure their authenticity and integrity.\n\nThis documentation will guide you through the process of Docker image signing and verification, providing step-by-step instructions, code snippets, troubleshooting tips, and best practices.\n\n### Objective and Scope\nThe objective of this documentation is to help you understand and implement Docker image signing and verification. By the end of this guide, you should be able to sign Docker images using digital signatures and verify the authenticity and integrity of signed images.\n\nThe scope of this documentation covers the basic concepts of Docker image signing and verification, as well as practical instructions for signing and verifying Docker images.\n\n### Requirements and Pre-requisites\nTo follow this guide, you will need the following:\n- Docker installed on your system\n- Basic knowledge of Docker commands and concepts\n- A private key and a corresponding public key for signing and verifying Docker images\n\n### Step-by-Step Instructions\n1. Generate a private key and a corresponding public key pair using a tool like OpenSSL:\n   ```\n   $ openssl genrsa -out private.key 2048\n   $ openssl rsa -in private.key -pubout -out public.key\n   ```\n\n2. Sign a Docker image using the private key:\n   ```\n   $ docker trust sign <image>\n   ```\n\n3. Verify the authenticity and integrity of a signed Docker image using the corresponding public key:\n   ```\n   $ docker trust verify <image>\n   ```\n\n### Code Snippets and Commands\n- Generate a private key and a corresponding public key pair:\n  ```\n  $ openssl genrsa -out private.key 2048\n  $ openssl rsa -in private.key -pubout -out public.key\n  ```\n\n- Sign a Docker image:\n  ```\n  $ docker trust sign <image>\n  ```\n\n- Verify a signed Docker image:\n  ```\n  $ docker trust verify <image>\n  ```\n\n### Troubleshooting and Common Issues\n- If you encounter an error stating \"No private key available for signing\", make sure you have generated a private key and it is accessible to Docker.\n\n- If the verification process fails with an error message, double-check that you are using the correct public key and that the image has not been tampered with.\n\n### Best Practices and Recommendations\n- Keep your private key secure and protected. Do not share it with unauthorized individuals.\n\n- Regularly rotate your private key to enhance security.\n\n- Verify the authenticity and integrity of Docker images before deploying them in production environments.\n\n### Summary and Conclusion\nDocker image signing and verification is an essential practice for ensuring the authenticity and integrity of Docker images. By following the steps outlined in this documentation, you can sign and verify Docker images using digital signatures. Remember to keep your private key secure and regularly verify the signed images before deploying them."
