Docker containers are lightweight, isolated environments that can run on any machine with Docker installed. Docker environment variables are a way to pass configuration information to your Docker containers.\n\n### Objective and Scope\nThe objective of this documentation is to provide a comprehensive guide on how to use environment variables in Docker. It covers the necessary requirements and pre-requisites, step-by-step instructions, code snippets and commands, troubleshooting tips, and best practices.\n\n### Requirements and Pre-requisites\nTo follow this guide, you will need:\n- Docker installed on your machine\n- Basic knowledge of Docker concepts and commands\n\n### Step-by-Step Instructions\n1. Define environment variables in your Dockerfile:\n   ```Dockerfile\n   ENV VARIABLE_NAME=value\n   ```\n\n2. Build your Docker image:\n   ```shell\n   docker build -t IMAGE_NAME .\n   ```\n\n3. Run a Docker container with the environment variables:\n   ```shell\n   docker run -e VARIABLE_NAME=value IMAGE_NAME\n   ```\n\n4. Access the environment variable from within the container:\n   ```shell\n   echo $VARIABLE_NAME\n   ```\n\n### Code Snippets and Commands\n- Dockerfile example:\n  ```Dockerfile\n  FROM ubuntu\n  ENV MY_VARIABLE=my_value\n  ```\n\n- Build Docker image:\n  ```shell\n  docker build -t my_image .\n  ```\n\n- Run Docker container with environment variable:\n  ```shell\n  docker run -e MY_VARIABLE=my_value my_image\n  ```\n\n- Access environment variable from within the container:\n  ```shell\n  echo $MY_VARIABLE\n  ```\n\n### Troubleshooting and Common Issues\n- Issue: Environment variable not being set in the container.\n  - Solution: Check if the environment variable is correctly defined in the Dockerfile and passed correctly when running the container.\n\n### Best Practices and Recommendations\n- Use meaningful names for your environment variables to improve readability and maintainability.\n- Avoid hardcoding sensitive information in your Dockerfile. Instead, use environment variables to pass them securely.\n\n### Summary and Conclusion\nDocker environment variables are a powerful tool for configuring your Docker containers. By following the step-by-step instructions in this guide, you should now have a good understanding of how to use environment variables in Docker. Remember to adhere to best practices and recommendations to ensure optimal performance and security in your Docker environment."
