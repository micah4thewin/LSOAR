Nutria are large semi-aquatic rodents native to South America. They were introduced to Oregon in the 1930s for fur farming but escaped into the wild. Since then, nutria populations have expanded rapidly, causing significant damage to wetlands, agricultural fields, and water infrastructure.\n\n## Physical Characteristics\nNutria are characterized by their robust bodies, webbed hind feet, and long, cylindrical tails. They have dense, waterproof fur that ranges in color from dark brown to reddish-brown. Adult nutria can grow up to 2.5 feet (0.75 meters) in length and weigh between 15 to 20 pounds (6.8 to 9 kilograms). They have large, orange-colored incisors that continuously grow throughout their lives.\n\n## Habitat and Distribution\nNutria are well-adapted to wetland habitats, including marshes, swamps, and rivers. In Oregon, they are primarily found in the Willamette Valley, where the climate and abundance of wetlands provide suitable conditions for their survival. Nutria are also found in other parts of the United States, including the Gulf Coast states and the Chesapeake Bay region.\n\n## Behavior and Lifestyle\nNutria are primarily active during the night and spend a significant amount of time in the water. They are excellent swimmers and can remain submerged for several minutes. Nutria are social animals and often live in small family groups consisting of a male, a female, and their offspring. They construct burrows in the banks of water bodies, which serve as shelter and nesting sites.\n\n## Diet\nNutria are herbivorous and primarily feed on aquatic vegetation, such as cattails, water lilies, and grasses. They are known to be voracious eaters and can consume large quantities of vegetation, which can lead to the destruction of wetland habitats. Nutria also have a unique feeding behavior known as \"coring,\" where they dig into the roots of plants to access the nutrient-rich underground parts.\n\n## Reproduction and Lifecycle\nNutria have a high reproductive rate, with females capable of producing multiple litters in a year. The gestation period lasts around 130 days, after which the female gives birth to a litter of 1 to 13 young, with an average of 5 to 7. The young, called kits, are born fully furred and with their eyes open. They are able to swim within hours of birth and become independent after around 3 months.\n\n## Conservation Status\nNutria are considered an invasive species in Oregon and pose a threat to native wildlife and ecosystems. Efforts are being made to control their population through trapping and removal programs. The Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife has implemented regulations to prevent the spread of nutria and is working with other agencies and organizations to monitor and manage their impact.\n\n## Cultural and Historical Significance\nNutria have no significant cultural or historical significance in Oregon. They were introduced for fur farming purposes but have since become a nuisance due to their destructive feeding habits and ability to rapidly reproduce.\n\n## Trivia\n- Nutria are sometimes referred to as \"swamp rats\" due to their appearance and habitat preferences.\n- The fur of nutria was once highly valued in the fur industry and was used to make coats, hats, and other garments.\n- Nutria are excellent diggers and can construct burrows with multiple chambers for different purposes.\n\n## Summary Points\n- Nutria are large semi-aquatic rodents native to South America.\n- They were introduced to Oregon in the 1930s and have since become an invasive species.\n- Nutria primarily inhabit wetland habitats and are known for their destructive feeding habits.\n- Efforts are being made to control nutria populations in Oregon through trapping and removal programs.\n- Nutria have no significant cultural or historical significance in the region.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n1. Are nutria dangerous to humans?\n   - Nutria are generally not dangerous to humans. However, they can be aggressive if cornered or threatened and may bite or scratch in self-defense. It is best to keep a safe distance from wild nutria.\n2. Can nutria be hunted for their fur?\n   - In Oregon, there are regulations regarding the hunting and trapping of nutria. It is important to check with local authorities and obtain the necessary permits and licenses before engaging in hunting or trapping activities."
