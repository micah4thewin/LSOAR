It is a significant and iconic species in the region, playing an important role in the ecosystem and cultural heritage of the area.\n\n## Physical Characteristics\nThe Columbia River Sturgeon is a massive fish, often reaching lengths of over 10 feet and weighing several hundred pounds. It has a cylindrical body with a long snout and a flat, shark-like tail. The coloration of the sturgeon varies, but it is typically dark gray or brown on the back and lighter on the belly. One of its most distinctive features is its bony plates, known as scutes, which run in rows along its body.\n\n## Habitat and Distribution\nThe Columbia River Sturgeon is primarily found in the Columbia River basin, including the mainstem of the Columbia River and its tributaries in Oregon. It prefers deep, slow-moving waters with sandy or gravelly bottoms. The sturgeon is anadromous, meaning it spends part of its life in the ocean and part in freshwater. It migrates between the ocean and the river for spawning, with adults returning to their natal rivers to reproduce.\n\n## Behavior and Lifestyle\nColumbia River Sturgeon are known for their longevity, with some individuals living over 100 years. They are bottom-dwelling fish, often found near the riverbed, where they feed on small fish, crustaceans, and other invertebrates. Sturgeons are primarily solitary, but they may gather in groups during spawning migrations. They are also known to leap out of the water, a behavior called \"breaching,\" which is believed to be a form of communication or territorial display.\n\n## Diet\nThe diet of the Columbia River Sturgeon consists mainly of small fish, such as salmon, herring, and smelt. They are opportunistic feeders and will also consume crustaceans, worms, and other invertebrates found on the riverbed. Sturgeons have a unique feeding mechanism called suction feeding, where they rapidly expand their mouths to create a vacuum that sucks in prey.\n\n## Reproduction and Lifecycle\nColumbia River Sturgeon have a complex reproductive cycle. They reach sexual maturity between 8 and 20 years of age, depending on their sex and size. Spawning occurs in the spring, with females releasing millions of eggs into the river. Males release sperm to fertilize the eggs externally. After spawning, the adults return to the ocean, while the eggs hatch into larvae known as \"fry.\" The fry drift downstream and eventually migrate back to the river as juveniles. As they grow, they gradually transition from a bottom-dwelling lifestyle to a more pelagic one.\n\n## Conservation Status\nThe Columbia River Sturgeon is currently listed as a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). However, specific populations within the Columbia River basin may be threatened or endangered due to habitat degradation, overfishing, and other human activities. Conservation efforts are in place to monitor and manage sturgeon populations, including fishing regulations, habitat restoration projects, and research on their biology and behavior.\n\n## Cultural and Historical Significance\nThe Columbia River Sturgeon holds great cultural and historical significance for the indigenous tribes of the region, such as the Nez Perce, Yakama, and Umatilla. These tribes have long relied on the sturgeon as a source of food, materials, and ceremonial significance. Sturgeon fishing has been an integral part of their culture and traditions for generations. The sturgeon also has a place in local folklore and legends, often symbolizing strength and resilience.\n\n## Trivia\n- The Columbia River Sturgeon is one of the largest freshwater fish species in North America.\n- Sturgeons are considered living fossils, as they have remained relatively unchanged for millions of years.\n- The oldest recorded Columbia River Sturgeon was estimated to be over 150 years old.\n- The sturgeon is a popular sport fish, attracting anglers from around the world to the Columbia River.\n\n## Summary Points\n- The Columbia River Sturgeon is a large and ancient fish species found in the Columbia River basin in Oregon.\n- It has a cylindrical body, bony plates along its body, and can reach lengths of over 10 feet.\n- The sturgeon prefers deep, slow-moving waters and is anadromous, migrating between the ocean and the river for spawning.\n- It feeds on small fish and invertebrates using suction feeding.\n- Reproduction involves external fertilization, and the sturgeon has a complex lifecycle.\n- The species is of least concern, but specific populations may be threatened or endangered.\n- The sturgeon has cultural and historical significance for indigenous tribes and is a popular sport fish.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n1. Are Columbia River Sturgeons dangerous to humans?\n   - No, Columbia River Sturgeons are not dangerous to humans. They are primarily bottom-feeders and pose no threat to people.\n\n2. Can you eat Columbia River Sturgeon?\n   - Yes, Columbia River Sturgeon is considered a delicacy and is often sought after for its meat. However, fishing regulations and size limits are in place to ensure sustainable harvest."
