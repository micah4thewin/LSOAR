It is a significant species due to its unique characteristics and ecological importance.\n\n## Physical Characteristics\nThe Green Sturgeon is a large fish, with adults reaching lengths of up to 7 feet and weighing over 200 pounds. It has a streamlined body covered in bony plates called scutes, which provide protection. The coloration of the Green Sturgeon is typically dark green or gray on the back and sides, with a lighter belly. One distinctive feature of this species is its long snout, which is used for bottom-feeding.\n\n## Habitat and Distribution\nGreen Sturgeon can be found along the Pacific coast of North America, from Alaska to California. In Washington, they are commonly found in the Columbia River and its tributaries. They prefer deep, slow-moving waters, such as estuaries and large rivers. These fish are known to migrate between freshwater and saltwater environments.\n\n## Behavior and Lifestyle\nGreen Sturgeon are primarily bottom-feeders, using their snouts to stir up sediment and search for food. They are known to feed on a variety of organisms, including small fish, crustaceans, and mollusks. These sturgeon are not known for their social behavior and are often solitary creatures. They have been observed to migrate upstream to spawn during the breeding season.\n\n## Diet\nThe diet of Green Sturgeon consists mainly of small fish, such as herring and smelt, as well as crustaceans and mollusks. They use their snouts to root around in the sediment and suck up prey items. This species has a unique feeding habit of swallowing prey whole, as it lacks teeth for chewing.\n\n## Reproduction and Lifecycle\nGreen Sturgeon have a long lifespan, with some individuals living over 60 years. They reach sexual maturity between 8 and 14 years of age. Breeding typically occurs in freshwater environments, where females release thousands of eggs into the water. The eggs are fertilized externally by the males. The larvae hatch and spend several months drifting downstream before migrating to the ocean. After several years in the ocean, they return to freshwater to spawn.\n\n## Conservation Status\nThe Green Sturgeon is listed as a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). However, certain populations, including those in Washington, are considered threatened or endangered. Overfishing, habitat degradation, and barriers to migration pose significant threats to the survival of this species. Conservation efforts include fishing regulations, habitat restoration, and the removal of barriers to migration.\n\n## Cultural and Historical Significance\nGreen Sturgeon holds cultural and historical significance for indigenous communities in Washington. They are considered a sacred species and are part of traditional ceremonies and legends. Historically, Green Sturgeon were an important food source for indigenous peoples, providing sustenance and materials for various purposes.\n\n## Trivia\n- Green Sturgeon is one of the largest freshwater fish species in North America.\n- They are ancient fish, with fossil records dating back over 200 million years.\n- The Green Sturgeon is the only species of sturgeon found on the West Coast of the United States.\n\n## Summary Points\n- Green Sturgeon is a large fish found in Washington's waters.\n- They have a distinctive long snout and bony scutes covering their bodies.\n- Green Sturgeon prefer deep, slow-moving waters and migrate between freshwater and saltwater environments.\n- They are primarily bottom-feeders, consuming small fish, crustaceans, and mollusks.\n- Breeding occurs in freshwater, and the larvae drift downstream before migrating to the ocean.\n- Green Sturgeon face conservation challenges due to overfishing and habitat degradation.\n- They hold cultural and historical significance for indigenous communities in Washington.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n1. Is the Green Sturgeon a threatened species?\n   - While the species as a whole is considered of least concern, certain populations, including those in Washington, are threatened or endangered.\n\n2. How long do Green Sturgeon live?\n   - Green Sturgeon have a long lifespan and can live over 60 years.\n\n3. What is the significance of Green Sturgeon in indigenous cultures?\n   - Green Sturgeon is considered a sacred species and plays a role in traditional ceremonies and legends. It was also historically an important food source for indigenous communities."
