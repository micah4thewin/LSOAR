They become independent at around 6 months of age.\n\n## Conservation Status\nThe Animals Oregon Coastal Marten is currently listed as a federally endangered species due to habitat loss, logging activities, and fragmentation of its range. Conservation efforts are focused on protecting its remaining habitat and conducting research to better understand its population dynamics.\n\n## Cultural and Historical Significance\nThe Oregon Coastal Marten holds cultural significance for Native American tribes in the region. It is often featured in legends and stories as a symbol of stealth, agility, and adaptability.\n\n## Trivia\n- The Oregon Coastal Marten is closely related to the Pacific marten (Martes caurina) found in other regions of the Pacific Northwest.\n- It is one of the rarest carnivores in the United States.\n- The marten's fur was historically prized for its quality and used in the fur trade.\n\n## Summary Points\n- The Oregon Coastal Marten is a small carnivorous mammal found in the coastal regions of Oregon.\n- It has a dark brown fur coat, a slender body, and a bushy tail.\n- This species prefers old-growth forests and is endemic to the Siskiyou and Klamath Mountains.\n- The marten is primarily nocturnal, solitary, and an agile climber.\n- Its diet consists of small mammals, birds, reptiles, insects, and occasional fruits.\n- Breeding occurs in the summer, and the kits become independent at around 6 months of age.\n- The Oregon Coastal Marten is currently endangered due to habitat loss and fragmentation.\n- It holds cultural significance for Native American tribes in the region.\n- Interesting facts include its close relation to the Pacific marten and its historical importance in the fur trade.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n1. Are Oregon Coastal Martens dangerous to humans?\n   - No, Oregon Coastal Martens are not dangerous to humans. They are small and generally avoid human interaction.\n2.
