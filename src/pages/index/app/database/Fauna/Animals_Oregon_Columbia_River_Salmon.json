These salmon are highly valued for their commercial, recreational, and cultural importance.\n\n## Physical Characteristics\nColumbia River Salmon are large fish, with adults typically measuring between 24 to 36 inches in length and weighing around 10 to 30 pounds. They have streamlined bodies, allowing them to swim efficiently through the water. These salmon have a silver coloration on their sides and a bluish-green hue on their backs. One of their most distinctive features is their hooked jaws, which develop in males during the spawning season.\n\n## Habitat and Distribution\nColumbia River Salmon can be found in the Columbia River Basin, which spans multiple states including Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and Montana. They are anadromous, meaning they spend part of their lives in freshwater rivers and streams before migrating to the ocean. These salmon prefer cool, clean, and well-oxygenated waters for spawning and rearing. The Columbia River and its tributaries provide essential habitat for their lifecycle.\n\n## Behavior and Lifestyle\nThese salmon exhibit complex behaviors throughout their lives. They are known for their remarkable ability to navigate long distances, returning to their natal streams to spawn. Columbia River Salmon typically migrate from the ocean to freshwater rivers during the spring and summer months. During spawning, males develop a reddish coloration and compete for mates. After spawning, most adults die, while the young salmon, called fry, remain in freshwater for several months before migrating to the ocean.\n\n## Diet\nColumbia River Salmon are carnivorous and primarily feed on small fish, such as herring and anchovies, as well as crustaceans and insects. They have a keen sense of smell, allowing them to detect prey in the water. These salmon are also known to consume plankton and other microscopic organisms during their time in the ocean.\n\n## Reproduction and Lifecycle\nThe reproductive habits of Columbia River Salmon are fascinating. After returning to their natal streams, females create nests, called redds, by digging depressions in the gravel beds. They lay their eggs in these redds, and males fertilize them externally. The eggs then develop and hatch into alevins, which remain in the gravel for a few weeks. Once they emerge, they become fry and begin their journey downstream to the ocean. After spending several years in the ocean, these salmon return to their natal streams to repeat the cycle.\n\n## Conservation Status\nColumbia River Salmon face numerous threats to their survival, including habitat degradation, overfishing, and the impacts of dams on their migratory routes. As a result, their populations have declined significantly over the years. The species is currently listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. Various conservation efforts are in place, including habitat restoration projects, fish passage improvements, and fishing regulations to protect and restore their populations.\n\n## Cultural and Historical Significance\nColumbia River Salmon hold immense cultural and historical significance to the indigenous peoples of the region. They have been a vital food source for Native American tribes for thousands of years, providing sustenance and playing a central role in their cultural practices and traditions. The salmon's life cycle and return to their spawning grounds are celebrated through ceremonies and festivals.\n\n## Trivia\n- Columbia River Salmon can travel over 900 miles from the ocean to their spawning grounds.\n- These salmon have a strong homing instinct, allowing them to navigate back to the exact stream where they were born.\n- The Columbia River Basin was once home to one of the largest salmon runs in the world, with millions of salmon returning each year.\n\n## Summary Points\n- Columbia River Salmon are large fish with silver coloration and distinctive hooked jaws.\n- They can be found in the Columbia River Basin and migrate between freshwater rivers and the ocean.\n- These salmon exhibit complex behaviors, including long-distance migration and spawning rituals.\n- Their diet consists of small fish, crustaceans, and insects.\n- Columbia River Salmon are currently listed as threatened and face various conservation challenges.\n- They hold significant cultural and historical importance to indigenous communities in the region.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n1. Are Columbia River Salmon safe to eat?\n   - Yes, Columbia River Salmon are safe to eat and are enjoyed by many people. However, it is important to follow fishing regulations and advisories to ensure the safety and sustainability of the fishery.\n\n2. How long do Columbia River Salmon live?\n   - The lifespan of Columbia River Salmon varies depending on their specific life history. On average, they live for about 4 to 7 years, although some individuals can live up to 10 years."
