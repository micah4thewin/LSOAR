Males have long, sharp spurs on their legs, which they use for defense and during mating displays.\n\n## Habitat and Distribution\nThe Animals_Oregon_Wild_Turkey can be found in various habitats throughout Oregon, including forests, woodlands, and open grasslands. They prefer areas with a mix of trees for roosting and open spaces for foraging. The distribution of the Animals_Oregon_Wild_Turkey in Oregon is primarily in the western and southern parts of the state.\n\n## Behavior and Lifestyle\nAnimals_Oregon_Wild_Turkeys are diurnal birds, meaning they are active during the day. They are social animals and often form flocks, especially during the winter months. These flocks can consist of both males and females, but during the breeding season, males establish dominance hierarchies and engage in elaborate courtship displays to attract females.\n\nDuring courtship displays, males puff up their feathers, fan out their tail feathers, and strut while making vocalizations. This behavior is commonly known as \"strutting\" and is a spectacle to observe. Animals_Oregon_Wild_Turkeys are also known for their ability to fly, although they prefer to walk or run on the ground.\n\n## Diet\nThe Animals_Oregon_Wild_Turkey is an omnivorous bird, feeding on a variety of foods. Their diet consists of seeds, nuts, fruits, insects, small reptiles, and amphibians. They are opportunistic feeders and will adapt their diet based on the available food sources in their habitat. Animals_Oregon_Wild_Turkeys use their strong beaks to forage on the ground and can scratch the soil to uncover food.\n\n## Reproduction and Lifecycle\nThe breeding season for Animals_Oregon_Wild_Turkeys typically occurs in the spring. Males will display their feathers and vocalize to attract females. Once a female is chosen, she will build a nest on the ground in a concealed location, such as tall grass or shrubs.

The poults grow quickly and can fly short distances within two weeks.\n\n## Conservation Status\nThe Animals_Oregon_Wild_Turkey is not currently listed as a threatened or endangered species.
