The state's unique geography and climate provide habitats for a wide range of animals. In this article, we will explore the fascinating world of Nevada wildlife and learn about the various species that call this state their home.\n\n## Key Terms\n- Habitat: The natural environment where an organism lives and thrives.\n- Endangered: A species that is at risk of extinction.\n- Ecosystem: A community of living organisms and their interactions with each other and their environment.\n- Migration: The seasonal movement of animals from one place to another.\n\n## Detailed Explanation\nNevada is known for its vast deserts, but it also boasts mountain ranges, forests, and wetlands. These diverse landscapes support a rich variety of wildlife. Some of the iconic animals found in Nevada include:\n\n1. Desert Bighorn Sheep: These majestic creatures are well adapted to the harsh desert environment. They have large curved horns and can be found in rocky areas, where they can easily navigate steep slopes.\n\n2. Mountain Lions: Also known as cougars or pumas, mountain lions are powerful predators that inhabit Nevada's mountainous regions. They are solitary animals and are known for their stealth and agility.\n\n3. Pronghorn Antelope: The pronghorn is the fastest land mammal in North America. They are known for their incredible speed and can reach speeds of up to 60 miles per hour. Pronghorn can be found in Nevada's grasslands and sagebrush steppe.\n\n4.
