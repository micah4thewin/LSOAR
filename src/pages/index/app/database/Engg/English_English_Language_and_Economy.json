The spread of the British Empire during the 17th and 18th centuries contributed to the global influence of the English language. The Industrial Revolution further propelled the economic power of English-speaking nations, solidifying English as the language of trade and commerce.\n\n## Essential English Skills\nTo thrive in the global economy, individuals need to possess essential English language skills. These skills include proficiency in reading, writing, speaking, and listening. Effective communication, both written and verbal, is crucial for conducting business negotiations, collaborating with international partners, and presenting ideas persuasively.\n\n## Notable Authors and Works\nEnglish literature has produced numerous notable authors whose works have shaped the language and influenced economic discourse.
