Seek medical attention for severe burns or if the burn covers a large area.\n\n## Trauma and Injury Management\n1. **Scalp Hematoma**: Apply a cold compress to reduce swelling. Monitor for signs of increased pressure, such as severe headache or changes in consciousness, and seek medical attention if necessary.\n2. **Hairline Fracture**: Apply ice to reduce swelling and provide pain relief. Rest and avoid activities that worsen the pain. Seek medical attention for severe pain or if there is a visible deformity.\n3. **Scalp Avulsion**: Gently clean the avulsed skin with saline solution or clean water. Place the avulsed skin in a clean, moist cloth or plastic bag and seek immediate medical attention.\n\n## Illness Identification and Home Remedies\n1. **Dandruff**: Use over-the-counter anti-dandruff shampoos containing ingredients like zinc pyrithione or ketoconazole.

Avoid scratching and keep the scalp moisturized.\n\n## Diagnostic Skills\n1. **Observation**: Observe the scalp for any abnormalities, such as redness, swelling, or lesions.\n2. **Physical Examination**: Gently palpate the scalp to check for tenderness, lumps, or irregularities.\n3. **History Taking**: Ask about symptoms, duration, and any recent exposure to potential irritants or allergens.\n\n## Advanced Treatment\n1. **Hair Transplantation**: Consult a dermatologist or hair transplant specialist for evaluation and treatment options.\n2. **Scalp Micro-pigmentation**: Consider this technique for individuals with thinning hair or baldness.
