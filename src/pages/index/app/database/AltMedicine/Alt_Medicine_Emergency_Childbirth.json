Create a clean and comfortable environment: Clear the area and gather clean towels or sheets to provide a clean and soft surface for the mother.\n3. Support the mother: Help the mother find a comfortable position and encourage her to breathe deeply and relax.\n4. Assist with the delivery: If the baby's head is visible, support the head and gently guide the baby out during contractions. Do not pull or force the baby.\n5.

If any concerns arise, do not hesitate to seek professional medical help.\n\n## Advanced Treatment\nIn emergency childbirth situations, it is important to focus on immediate care and seek professional medical assistance as soon as possible. Advanced treatments, such as administering medications or performing medical procedures, should be left to trained healthcare professionals.\n\n## Preventive Measures\nPreventive measures can significantly reduce the risk of emergency childbirth situations.
