Elevate the injured area if possible to help reduce blood flow.\n\n2. **Clean the wound**: Rinse the wound with clean water to remove dirt and debris. Avoid using hydrogen peroxide or alcohol, as they may delay healing.\n\n3. **Apply an antiseptic**: After cleaning the wound, apply an antiseptic solution such as povidone-iodine or chlorhexidine to help prevent infection.\n\n4. **Cover the wound**: Use a sterile dressing or clean cloth to cover the wound. Secure it in place with adhesive tape or a bandage.\n\n## Trauma and Injury Management\nDifferent types of injuries require specific management techniques.
