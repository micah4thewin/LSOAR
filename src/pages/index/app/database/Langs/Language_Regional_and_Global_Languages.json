Another notable figure is [Ferdinand de Saussure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_de_Saussure), whose work on structural linguistics laid the foundation for modern linguistics. These linguists, among many others, have contributed to our understanding of Language_Regional_and_Global_Languages.\n\n### Impact on Communication\nLanguage_Regional_and_Global_Languages plays a crucial role in effective communication.
