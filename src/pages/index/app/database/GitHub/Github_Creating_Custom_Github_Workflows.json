Github workflows allow you to automate tasks and processes within your Github repository, improving productivity and efficiency.\n\n### Objective and Scope\nThe objective of this documentation is to help users understand and implement custom Github workflows. It covers the necessary requirements and pre-requisites, provides detailed instructions, code snippets, troubleshooting solutions, and best practices.\n\n### Requirements and Pre-requisites\nBefore creating custom Github workflows, ensure that you have the following:\n\n- A Github account\n- Access to a Github repository\n- Basic knowledge of Git and Github\n\n### Step-by-Step Instructions\n\n1. **Create a new workflow file**: In your Github repository, navigate to the `.github/workflows` directory. Create a new file with a `.yml` extension. This file will define your custom workflow.\n\n2. **Define the workflow**: Open the newly created workflow file and define the workflow using YAML syntax. Specify the name, trigger events, and jobs. For example:\n\n   ```yaml\n   name: Custom Workflow\n   on:\n     push:\n       branches:\n         - main\n     pull_request:\n       branches:\n         - main\n   jobs:\n     build:\n       runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n       steps:\n         - name: Checkout code\n           uses: actions/checkout@v2\n         - name: Build project\n           run: |\n             npm install\n             npm run build\n         - name: Deploy\n           uses: some-action/deploy@v1\n           with:\n             token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n   ```\n\n   This example workflow triggers on push and pull request events on the `main` branch. It defines a single job named `build` that runs on an Ubuntu environment. The steps include checking out the code, building the project, and deploying it using a custom action.\n\n3. **Commit and push the workflow file**: Save the changes to the workflow file and commit them to your repository. Push the changes to trigger the workflow. The workflow will automatically run based on the specified trigger events.\n\n### Code Snippets and Commands\n\n- To create a new workflow file, use the following command:\n\n  ```bash\n  touch .github/workflows/custom-workflow.yml\n  ```\n\n- To define the workflow, use YAML syntax in the workflow file. Refer to the [Github Actions documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) for more information on syntax and available actions.\n\n- To commit and push the workflow file to your repository, use the following commands:\n\n  ```bash\n  git add .github/workflows/custom-workflow.yml\n  git commit -m \"Add custom workflow\"\n  git push\n  ```\n\n### Troubleshooting and Common Issues\n\n- If your workflow is not triggering, ensure that you have correctly specified the trigger events and branch names in the workflow file.\n\n- If your workflow fails to run, check the workflow logs for error messages and review the steps and actions used in the workflow.\n\n- If you encounter authentication issues when using custom actions, ensure that you have provided the necessary credentials or tokens in the workflow file.\n\n### Best Practices and Recommendations\n\n- Keep your workflows modular and reusable by creating separate files for different tasks or stages of your CI/CD pipeline.\n\n- Use environment variables and secrets to securely store sensitive information, such as API keys or access tokens.\n\n- Regularly review and optimize your workflows to ensure they are efficient and follow best practices.\n\n- Leverage the Github Actions marketplace to find pre-built actions that can help automate common tasks.\n\n### Summary and Conclusion\n\nCreating custom Github workflows allows you to automate tasks and processes within your Github repository. This documentation provided a step-by-step guide on how to create custom workflows, along with code snippets, troubleshooting solutions, and best practices. By leveraging Github workflows, you can improve productivity and streamline your development processes."
