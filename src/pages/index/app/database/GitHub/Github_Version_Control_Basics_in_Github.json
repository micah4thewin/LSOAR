This documentation will provide a comprehensive guide on the basics of version control using Github.\n\n### Objective and Scope\nThe objective of this documentation is to familiarize users with the fundamental concepts and operations of version control in Github. It will cover topics such as creating repositories, making commits, branching, merging, and resolving conflicts.\n\n### Requirements and Pre-requisites\nTo follow along with this documentation, you will need:\n- A Github account\n- Basic knowledge of Git version control system\n\n### Step-by-Step Instructions\n1. [Creating a Repository](#creating-a-repository)\n2. [Cloning a Repository](#cloning-a-repository)\n3. [Making Commits](#making-commits)\n4. [Branching](#branching)\n5. [Merging](#merging)\n6. [Resolving Conflicts](#resolving-conflicts)\n\n#### Creating a Repository\n1. Go to the Github homepage and log in to your account.\n2. Click on the \"New\" button to create a new repository.\n3. Enter a name for your repository and choose the desired settings.\n4. Click on the \"Create repository\" button.\n\n#### Cloning a Repository\n1. Open the terminal or command prompt on your local machine.\n2. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.\n3. Copy the repository URL from the Github repository page.\n4. Run the following command: `git clone <repository-url>`\n\n#### Making Commits\n1. Make changes to the files in your local repository.\n2. Use the `git status` command to see the changes.\n3. Stage the changes using the `git add <file>` command.\n4. Commit the changes using the `git commit -m \"commit message\"` command.\n\n#### Branching\n1. List all existing branches using the `git branch` command.\n2. Create a new branch using the `git branch <branch-name>` command.\n3. Switch to the new branch using the `git checkout <branch-name>` command.\n4. Make changes and commits on the new branch.\n\n#### Merging\n1. Switch back to the main branch using the `git checkout <main-branch>` command.\n2. Merge the changes from the other branch using the `git merge <branch-name>` command.\n3. Resolve any conflicts that may arise during the merge process.\n\n#### Resolving Conflicts\n1. Use the `git status` command to identify the files with conflicts.\n2. Open the conflicting files and resolve the conflicts manually.\n3. Use the `git add <file>` command to stage the resolved files.\n4. Commit the changes using the `git commit -m \"conflict resolution\"` command.\n\n### Code Snippets and Commands\n- `git clone <repository-url>` - Clones a repository to your local machine.\n- `git status` - Shows the status of your local repository.\n- `git add <file>` - Stages changes for commit.\n- `git commit -m \"commit message\"` - Commits changes with a commit message.\n- `git branch` - Lists all existing branches.\n- `git branch <branch-name>` - Creates a new branch.\n- `git checkout <branch-name>` - Switches to a different branch.\n- `git merge <branch-name>` - Merges changes from a branch to the current branch.\n\n### Troubleshooting and Common Issues\n- Conflict during merge: When merging branches, conflicts may occur if the same lines of code were modified. Resolve conflicts manually by editing the conflicting files.\n- Error cloning repository: Double-check the repository URL and make sure you have the necessary permissions to clone the repository.\n\n### Best Practices and Recommendations\n- Commit frequently: Make small, meaningful commits to track changes effectively.\n- Use descriptive commit messages: Clearly describe the changes made in each commit.\n- Pull before pushing: Always pull the latest changes from the remote repository before pushing your changes to avoid conflicts.\n\n### Summary and Conclusion\nThis documentation provided an overview of the basics of version control using Github. It covered creating repositories, making commits, branching, merging, resolving conflicts, and provided tips and best practices for optimal usage. By following these instructions, users should be able to effectively use Github for version control and collaboration."
