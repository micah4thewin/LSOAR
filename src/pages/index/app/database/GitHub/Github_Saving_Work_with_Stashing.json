Stashing is useful when you need to switch branches or work on a different task without losing your current changes.\n\n## Objective and Scope\nThe objective of this documentation is to help GitHub users understand how to use the stashing feature effectively. It covers the requirements, step-by-step instructions, code snippets, troubleshooting, best practices, and recommendations related to stashing.\n\n## Requirements and Pre-requisites\nTo use the stashing feature in GitHub, you need the following:\n\n- A GitHub account\n- Git installed on your local machine\n- Basic knowledge of Git commands and workflows\n\n## Step-by-Step Instructions\n1. Open your terminal or command prompt.\n\n2. Navigate to the directory where your Git repository is located.\n\n3. Check the status of your repository using the following command:\n   ```\n   git status\n   ```\n\n4. If you have any uncommitted changes that you want to save, stash them using the following command:\n   ```\n   git stash save \"Your stash message\"\n   ```\n\n5. Switch to a different branch using the following command:\n   ```\n   git checkout branch_name\n   ```\n\n6. Apply the stashed changes to the new branch using the following command:\n   ```\n   git stash apply\n   ```\n\n7. If you want to remove the stashed changes after applying them, use the following command:\n   ```\n   git stash drop\n   ```\n\n8. Check the status of your repository again using the `git status` command to ensure that the stashed changes were successfully applied.\n\n## Code Snippets and Commands\n- `git status`: This command shows the current status of your Git repository, including any uncommitted changes.\n- `git stash save \"Your stash message\"`: This command saves your changes in a stash with the provided message.\n- `git checkout branch_name`: This command switches to the specified branch.\n- `git stash apply`: This command applies the stashed changes to the current branch.\n- `git stash drop`: This command removes the stashed changes.\n\n## Troubleshooting and Common Issues\n- If you encounter conflicts when applying the stashed changes, you can use Git's merge or rebase commands to resolve them.\n- If you accidentally apply the wrong stash, you can use `git stash list` to see a list of available stashes and `git stash apply stash@{n}` to apply a specific stash.\n\n## Best Practices and Recommendations\n- Before stashing your changes, make sure to save any important files or changes in a separate location to avoid potential data loss.\n- Use descriptive stash messages to easily identify the purpose of each stash.\n- Regularly check the status of your repository to keep track of stashed changes and avoid conflicts.\n\n## Summary and Conclusion\nThe stashing feature in GitHub allows you to save and temporarily store changes without committing them. This documentation provided step-by-step instructions, code snippets, troubleshooting tips, and best practices to help you effectively use the stashing feature. By following these guidelines, you can switch branches or work on different tasks without losing your current changes."
