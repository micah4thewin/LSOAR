It covers various topics such as branching, merging, rebasing, and managing pull requests.\n\n### Objective and Scope\nThe objective of this documentation is to help users understand and utilize advanced repository management features on Github. It covers both basic and advanced techniques, allowing users to effectively manage their repositories and collaborate with others.\n\n### Requirements and Pre-requisites\nTo follow along with this documentation, you will need the following:\n- A Github account\n- Basic knowledge of Git and Github\n\n### Step-by-Step Instructions\n1. **Branching**\n   - Create a new branch: `git checkout -b branch_name`\n   - Switch to an existing branch: `git checkout branch_name`\n   - List all branches: `git branch`\n   - Delete a branch: `git branch -d branch_name`\n\n2. **Merging**\n   - Merge a branch into the current branch: `git merge branch_name`\n   - Resolve merge conflicts: \n     - Open the conflicting file(s) and manually resolve the conflicts\n     - Stage the resolved files: `git add file_name`\n     - Commit the merge: `git commit -m \"Merge branch_name\"`\n\n3. **Rebasing**\n   - Rebase the current branch onto another branch: `git rebase branch_name`\n   - Resolve conflicts during rebase: \n     - Follow the same steps as resolving merge conflicts\n\n4. **Managing Pull Requests**\n   - Create a pull request: \n     - Push your branch to Github: `git push origin branch_name`\n     - Go to the repository on Github and click on \"New pull request\"\n     - Select the base branch and compare branch for the pull request\n     - Add a title and description for the pull request\n     - Click on \"Create pull request\"\n   - Review and merge a pull request:\n     - Open the pull request on Github\n     - Review the changes and leave comments if necessary\n     - If the changes are satisfactory, click on \"Merge pull request\"\n\n### Code Snippets and Commands\n- Creating a new branch:\n  ```\n  git checkout -b branch_name\n  ```\n\n- Merging a branch into the current branch:\n  ```\n  git merge branch_name\n  ```\n\n- Resolving merge conflicts:\n  ```\n  git add file_name\n  git commit -m \"Merge branch_name\"\n  ```\n\n- Rebasing the current branch onto another branch:\n  ```\n  git rebase branch_name\n  ```\n\n### Troubleshooting and Common Issues\n- Conflict resolution during merging or rebasing can be challenging. Make sure to carefully review the conflicting files and resolve conflicts manually.\n\n### Best Practices and Recommendations\n- Before merging or rebasing, always ensure that your code is up to date with the latest changes from the base branch.\n- Regularly communicate and collaborate with other contributors to avoid conflicts and maintain a smooth workflow.\n\n### Summary and Conclusion\nThis documentation covered advanced repository management techniques on Github. It provided step-by-step instructions for branching, merging, rebasing, and managing pull requests. By following these techniques and best practices, users can effectively manage their repositories and collaborate with others in a structured and organized manner."
