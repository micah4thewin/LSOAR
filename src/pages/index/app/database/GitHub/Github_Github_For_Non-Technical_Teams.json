While it is commonly used by developers, Github can also be a valuable tool for non-technical teams. This documentation will guide non-technical teams on how to effectively use Github for their projects.\n\n## Objective and Scope\nThe objective of this documentation is to provide non-technical teams with a comprehensive guide on using Github. It will cover the basics of setting up a Github repository, collaborating with team members, managing projects, and utilizing Github's features for efficient workflow.\n\n## Requirements and Pre-requisites\nTo use Github, you will need:\n- An internet connection\n- A web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)\n- A Github account (sign up at [github.com](https://github.com))\n\n## Step-by-Step Instructions\n1. Sign in to your Github account.\n2. Create a new repository by clicking on the \"New\" button on the repository page.\n3. Enter a name for your repository and choose the visibility (public or private).\n4. Optionally, add a description and choose a license for your repository.\n5. Click on the \"Create repository\" button to create your repository.\n6. Clone the repository to your local machine using the command `git clone <repository-url>`.\n7. Add files to your repository by placing them in the cloned directory.\n8. Use the command `git add <file>` to add files to the staging area.\n9. Commit your changes using the command `git commit -m \"commit message\"`.\n10. Push your changes to the remote repository using the command `git push origin master`.\n11. Invite team members to collaborate on your repository by going to the \"Settings\" tab and selecting \"Manage access\".\n12.

Choose the access level for each team member (read, write, or admin).\n14. Click on the \"Add\" button to send the invitations.\n15. Collaborate with team members by creating and resolving issues, commenting on pull requests, and using project boards.\n\n## Code Snippets and Commands\n- `git clone <repository-url>`: Clone a repository to your local machine.\n- `git add <file>`: Add files to the staging area.\n- `git commit -m \"commit message\"`: Commit changes with a message.\n- `git push origin master`: Push changes to the remote repository.\n\n## Troubleshooting and Common Issues\n- If you encounter authentication issues, make sure you are using the correct username and password for your Github account.\n- If you are unable to clone a repository, check if you have the necessary permissions to access it.\n- If you are experiencing merge conflicts, communicate with your team members to resolve conflicts and ensure smooth collaboration.\n\n## Best Practices and Recommendations\n- Regularly commit and push your changes to avoid losing work.\n- Use descriptive commit messages to provide clear context for your changes.\n- Follow Git branching workflows to manage feature development and bug fixes.\n- Utilize project boards and issue tracking to keep track of tasks and progress.\n- Take advantage of Github's integrations with other tools, such as Slack and Trello, to streamline your workflow.\n\n## Summary and Conclusion\nGithub can be a valuable tool for non-technical teams to collaborate on projects and manage their work effectively. By following the step-by-step instructions in this documentation and implementing the best practices and recommendations, non-technical teams can make the most out of Github's features and improve their productivity."
