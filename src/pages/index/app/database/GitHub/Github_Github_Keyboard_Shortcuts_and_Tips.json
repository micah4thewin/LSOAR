This guide will provide you with a comprehensive list of keyboard shortcuts and useful tips to enhance your productivity while using Github.\n\n### Objective and Scope\nThe objective of this documentation is to help Github users navigate the platform more efficiently using keyboard shortcuts and provide tips to optimize their workflow. The scope of this documentation covers the most commonly used shortcuts and tips for Github.\n\n### Requirements and Pre-requisites\nThere are no specific requirements or pre-requisites to use Github keyboard shortcuts and tips. However, it is recommended to have a basic understanding of Github and its features.\n\n### Step-by-Step Instructions\n1. **Navigating Repositories**\n   - Use `g` + `r` to go to the repository list.\n   - Use `g` + `n` to go to the notifications.\n   - Use `g` + `p` to go to your profile.\n   - Use `g` + `h` to go to the homepage.\n   - Use `g` + `b` to go to your bookmarks.\n\n2. **Repository Actions**\n   - Use `t` to activate the file finder.\n   - Use `w` to activate the branch selector.\n   - Use `s` to activate the search bar.\n   - Use `y` to activate the emoji selector.\n   - Use `l` to activate the label selector.\n\n3. **Issue and Pull Request Navigation**\n   - Use `j` to move down to the next issue or pull request.\n   - Use `k` to move up to the previous issue or pull request.\n   - Use `o` to open the selected issue or pull request.\n   - Use `u` to go back to the list of issues or pull requests.\n   - Use `c` to create a new issue or pull request.\n\n4. **Commenting and Editing**\n   - Use `r` to reply to a comment.\n   - Use `e` to edit a comment.\n   - Use `m` to mute a conversation.\n   - Use `u` to mark a conversation as unread.\n   - Use `c` to comment on an issue or pull request.\n\n5. **File Navigation**\n   - Use `t` to activate the file finder.\n   - Use `↑` and `↓` to navigate through the files.\n   - Use `Enter` to open a file.\n   - Use `l` to jump to a specific line in a file.\n   - Use `y` to activate the blame view.\n\n### Code Snippets and Commands\nHere are some useful code snippets and commands to enhance your Github experience:\n\n- To create a new repository:\n```bash\n$ git init\n$ git remote add origin <repository_url>\n$ git add .\n$ git commit -m \"Initial commit\"\n$ git push -u origin master\n```\n\n- To clone a repository:\n```bash\n$ git clone <repository_url>\n```\n\n- To create a new branch:\n```bash\n$ git checkout -b <branch_name>\n```\n\n- To switch between branches:\n```bash\n$ git checkout <branch_name>\n```\n\n- To merge a branch into another branch:\n```bash\n$ git checkout <target_branch>\n$ git merge <source_branch>\n```\n\n### Troubleshooting and Common Issues\n- If you encounter any issues with keyboard shortcuts not working, make sure you are not in an input field or textarea. Keyboard shortcuts only work when you are not actively typing in a text field.\n\n- If you experience any unexpected behavior or errors, try clearing your browser cache and restarting your browser. This can often resolve minor issues with Github.\n\n### Best Practices and Recommendations\n- Familiarize yourself with the most commonly used keyboard shortcuts to improve your efficiency and productivity on Github.\n\n- Take advantage of the search bar and file finder to quickly locate repositories, files, and specific lines of code.\n\n- Use labels and branches to organize and categorize your work, making it easier to navigate and collaborate with others.\n\n- Regularly update your local repository by pulling the latest changes from the remote repository to stay up to date with the latest changes.\n\n### Summary and Conclusion\nIn conclusion, this documentation has provided you with a comprehensive list of Github keyboard shortcuts and useful tips to enhance your productivity while using the platform. By utilizing these shortcuts and following the best practices, you can streamline your workflow and navigate Github more efficiently."
