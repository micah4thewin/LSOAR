They serve as a way to communicate changes made to a codebase and provide clarity and context to future developers who review or work on the code. This document provides guidelines on writing effective commit messages on Github.\n\n### Objective and Scope\nThe objective of this document is to provide a set of guidelines to follow when writing commit messages on Github. It covers the best practices and recommendations for creating clear, concise, and informative commit messages. The scope of this document is limited to commit messages on Github and does not cover other version control systems or platforms.\n\n### Requirements and Pre-requisites\nThere are no specific requirements or pre-requisites for following these commit message guidelines. However, a basic understanding of Git and Github is assumed.\n\n### Step-by-Step Instructions\n1. Start with a short summary: Begin the commit message with a short summary that describes the changes made in the commit. Keep it concise and specific. For example: \"Fix bug in login form validation\".\n\n2. Use present tense: Write the commit message in the present tense. This helps to make the message more readable and consistent. For example: \"Add feature to search bar\" instead of \"Added feature to search bar\".\n\n3. Provide additional details: After the summary, provide additional details about the changes made in the commit. This can include the reasons for the change, any relevant context, or any impact it may have on the codebase. Use bullet points or paragraphs to organize the information.\n\n4. Reference related issues or pull requests: If the commit is related to a specific issue or pull request, reference it in the commit message. This helps to provide context and allows for easier tracking of changes. Use the \"#\" symbol followed by the issue or pull request number. For example: \"Fix bug in login form validation (#123)\".\n\n5. Keep lines within 72 characters: Try to keep each line of the commit message within 72 characters. This helps to maintain readability and ensures that the message is displayed properly in various Git tools and interfaces.\n\n6. Use imperative mood: When describing the changes in the commit, use the imperative mood. This means starting each line with a verb. For example: \"Fix bug in login form validation\" instead of \"Fixed bug in login form validation\".\n\n### Code Snippets and Commands\nThere are no specific code snippets or commands related to commit message guidelines. However, here are a few examples of well-formatted commit messages:\n\n- \"Add feature to search bar\"\n- \"Fix bug in login form validation (#123)\"\n- \"Refactor code for better performance\"\n- \"Update documentation for API endpoints\"\n\n### Troubleshooting and Common Issues\nThere are no common issues or troubleshooting steps related to commit message guidelines. However, if you encounter any difficulties or have questions, feel free to reach out to the project team or consult the Github documentation.\n\n### Best Practices and Recommendations\n- Keep commit messages concise and specific.\n- Use the present tense and imperative mood.\n- Provide additional details when necessary.\n- Reference related issues or pull requests.\n- Keep lines within 72 characters.\n- Follow any specific commit message conventions or guidelines set by the project or organization.\n\n### Summary and Conclusion\nWriting effective commit messages is essential for maintaining a clear and well-documented codebase. By following the guidelines outlined in this document, developers can improve collaboration, code readability, and project management on Github. Remember to keep commit messages concise, specific, and informative to provide clarity and context to future developers."
