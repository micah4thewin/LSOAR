Both mutual funds and ETFs are investment vehicles that pool money from multiple investors to invest in a diversified portfolio of securities. However, there are significant differences in their structure, management style, and trading characteristics.\n\n## Historical Context\nThe concept of mutual funds dates back to the 1920s when the first investment companies were established in the United States. Mutual funds gained popularity over the years as a convenient way for individual investors to access professional investment management.
