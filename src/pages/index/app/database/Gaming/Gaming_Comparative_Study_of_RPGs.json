Players assume the roles of fictional characters and navigate through immersive virtual worlds, often accompanied by a rich narrative and complex gameplay systems. The primary objective of RPGs is to progress the character's story, level up their abilities, and overcome challenges.\n\n## Rules and Mechanics\nRPGs typically feature a set of rules and mechanics that govern gameplay. These may include character creation, skill progression, combat systems, exploration, dialogue choices, and quest completion. RPGs often incorporate elements such as experience points, character stats, inventory management, and decision-making that impact the game's outcome.\n\n## Strategy and Tactics\nIn RPGs, players employ various strategies and tactics to succeed. This may involve optimizing character builds, choosing the right equipment, selecting appropriate skills or spells, and making decisions that align with the character's personality or moral alignment.
