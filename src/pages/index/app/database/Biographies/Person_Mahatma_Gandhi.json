He played a crucial role in India's struggle for independence from British rule and advocated for nonviolent civil disobedience as a means to achieve social and political change.\n\n## Key Terms\n- Nonviolence: The principle of using peaceful means to bring about social or political change.\n- Civil Disobedience: The refusal to comply with certain laws or regulations as a form of protest.\n- Satyagraha: Gandhi's concept of nonviolent resistance, emphasizing truth and moral force.\n\n## Detailed Life\nMahatma Gandhi was born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, Gujarat, India. He studied law in London and later became a lawyer in South Africa, where he first experienced racial discrimination. This experience sparked his interest in social justice and led him to develop his philosophy of nonviolent resistance.\n\nGandhi returned to India in 1915 and became actively involved in the Indian National Congress, advocating for the rights of Indians and promoting self-rule. He organized various nonviolent protests and campaigns, such as the Salt March in 1930, where thousands of Indians walked to the Arabian Sea to collect salt in defiance of the British salt tax.\n\nThroughout his life, Gandhi emphasized the importance of simplicity, truth, and self-discipline. He believed in the power of nonviolence and sought to unite people of different religions and castes in the pursuit of independence and social equality.\n\n## Little Known Facts\n- Gandhi was a vegetarian and practiced fasting regularly as a means of self-purification.\n- He was known for his simple lifestyle, often wearing a traditional loincloth and spinning his own cotton thread.\n- Gandhi was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize five times but never received it.\n\n## Examples\nOne of the most significant examples of Gandhi's influence was the Salt March mentioned earlier. The campaign aimed to challenge the British monopoly on salt production and distribution in India. By leading thousands of Indians in a peaceful protest, Gandhi demonstrated the power of nonviolent resistance and brought international attention to the Indian independence movement.\n\nAnother example of Gandhi's influence was his role in negotiating the end of the communal violence that erupted during the partition of India in 1947. Despite the widespread bloodshed and tensions between Hindus and Muslims, Gandhi worked tirelessly to promote peace and communal harmony.\n\n## Historical Context\nGandhi's life and work took place during a crucial period in India's history.
