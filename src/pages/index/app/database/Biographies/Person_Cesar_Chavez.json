He dedicated his life to advocating for the rights of farm workers and played a significant role in improving their working conditions. Chavez co-founded the National Farm Workers Association (NFWA), which later became the United Farm Workers (UFW) union. His tireless efforts and nonviolent approach made him a revered figure in the fight for social justice.\n\n## Key Terms\n- National Farm Workers Association (NFWA): The organization co-founded by Cesar Chavez that aimed to improve the working conditions and rights of farm workers.\n- United Farm Workers (UFW): The union formed by the merger of the NFWA and the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee (AWOC) in 1966.\n\n## Detailed Life\nCesar Chavez was born on March 31, 1927, in Yuma, Arizona. He grew up in a family of Mexican-American migrant workers and experienced firsthand the hardships and injustices faced by farm laborers. Chavez's family eventually settled in California, where he attended school until the eighth grade.\n\nIn the 1940s, Chavez joined the U.S. Navy and served for two years. After his military service, he worked as a farm laborer, gaining a deep understanding of the challenges faced by agricultural workers. Inspired by the teachings of Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr., Chavez became committed to nonviolent activism and the pursuit of social change.\n\nIn 1962, Chavez co-founded the National Farm Workers Association (NFWA) with Dolores Huerta. The organization aimed to address the exploitative working conditions, low wages, and lack of labor rights faced by farm workers. Through strikes, boycotts, and grassroots organizing, Chavez and the NFWA fought for better treatment and recognition of farm workers.\n\nIn 1965, the NFWA launched the Delano grape strike, a pivotal moment in Chavez's activism. The strike, supported by a nationwide boycott of table grapes, drew attention to the plight of farm workers and garnered widespread public support. The success of the Delano grape strike led to the signing of the first union contracts for agricultural workers.\n\nIn 1966, the NFWA merged with the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee (AWOC) to form the United Farm Workers (UFW). The UFW continued its advocacy for farm workers' rights and expanded its efforts to include issues such as pesticide exposure, healthcare, and immigration reform. Chavez led numerous strikes and boycotts, using nonviolent tactics to bring about change.\n\nChavez's activism extended beyond labor rights. He fought against discrimination and advocated for the rights of marginalized communities. He was a vocal critic of the Vietnam War and actively supported the Chicano Movement, which sought to empower Mexican-Americans and promote their cultural heritage.\n\nCesar Chavez passed away on April 23, 1993, but his legacy continues to inspire and influence social justice movements worldwide.\n\n## Little Known Facts\n- Cesar Chavez was a vegetarian and promoted the benefits of a plant-based diet.\n- He undertook several hunger strikes to protest against the use of violence and promote nonviolence as a means of achieving change.\n- Chavez was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Bill Clinton in 1994.\n\n## Examples\nOne of the most significant examples of Cesar Chavez's impact was the Delano grape strike. Through the strike and the subsequent nationwide boycott of table grapes, Chavez and the farm workers gained national attention and support. This led to improved working conditions, higher wages, and increased recognition for the rights of agricultural workers. The success of the grape boycott demonstrated the power of collective action and nonviolent resistance in achieving social change.\n\nAnother example of Chavez's relevance is his advocacy for immigrant rights. He recognized the struggles faced by immigrant farm workers and fought for their fair treatment and inclusion. Chavez understood the importance of solidarity among all workers, regardless of their immigration status, and emphasized the need for comprehensive immigration reform.\n\n## Historical Context\nCesar Chavez's activism took place during a time of significant social and political change in the United States.
