Despite her groundbreaking research, Franklin's achievements were often overshadowed during her lifetime. This article aims to shed light on the life and accomplishments of Rosalind Franklin.\n\n## Key Terms\n- DNA: Deoxyribonucleic acid, the molecule that contains the genetic instructions for the development and functioning of living organisms.\n- X-ray crystallography: A technique used to determine the three-dimensional structure of molecules by analyzing the diffraction patterns produced by X-rays passing through a crystal.\n\n## Detailed Life\nRosalind Franklin was born on July 25, 1920, in London, England. She showed an early interest in science and attended St Paul's Girls' School, where she excelled in physics and chemistry. Franklin went on to study natural sciences at Newnham College, Cambridge, where she obtained her undergraduate degree in 1941.\n\nAfter completing her studies, Franklin worked as a research associate at the British Coal Utilization Research Association. During this time, she gained expertise in X-ray crystallography, a technique that would later become crucial to her groundbreaking work on DNA.\n\nIn 1951, Franklin joined King's College London as a research associate. It was at King's College that she began her most significant research on the structure of DNA. Using X-ray crystallography, Franklin obtained high-resolution images of DNA fibers, which provided crucial insights into its structure.\n\nLittle Known Facts\n- Franklin's work on DNA was instrumental in the discovery of its double helix structure. However, her contributions were not fully recognized until after her death.\n- Franklin's research also played a key role in understanding the structure of viruses, including the tobacco mosaic virus.\n\n## Examples\nOne example of Franklin's relevance is her famous \"Photo 51,\" an X-ray diffraction image of DNA that provided critical evidence for its helical structure. This image, captured by Franklin in 1952, was shown to James Watson and Francis Crick without her knowledge or consent. It served as a crucial piece of evidence that contributed to Watson and Crick's subsequent model of the DNA double helix.\n\nAnother example is Franklin's research on the tobacco mosaic virus. By applying her expertise in X-ray crystallography, she was able to determine the virus's structure, which had significant implications for understanding viral diseases.\n\n## Historical Context\nRosalind Franklin's work took place during a time when the field of molecular biology was rapidly advancing. The discovery of the structure of DNA was a pivotal moment in scientific history, as it provided the foundation for understanding the mechanisms of heredity and paved the way for further breakthroughs in genetics and biotechnology.\n\n## Questions and Answers\n1. Q: What was Rosalind Franklin's role in the discovery of the DNA double helix?\n   - A: Rosalind Franklin's X-ray crystallography images, including \"Photo 51,\" provided crucial evidence for the helical structure of DNA, which contributed to the subsequent model proposed by James Watson and Francis Crick.\n\n2. Q: Why were Rosalind Franklin's contributions overlooked during her lifetime?\n   - A: Franklin's contributions were overshadowed partly due to the unauthorized use of her data by Watson and Crick, as well as the prevailing gender biases in the scientific community at the time.\n\n## Family-Friends\nRosalind Franklin was the second of five children born to Ellis Franklin and Muriel Waley. She had three sisters and one brother. Franklin was known for being a private person and focused primarily on her scientific work. She maintained close relationships with her family and had a small circle of friends within the scientific community.\n\n## Quotes\n- \"Science and everyday life cannot and should not be separated.\" \n- \"The X-ray technique I use is the only way in which you can see directly the structure of molecules.\"\n\nThese quotes from Rosalind Franklin highlight her dedication to scientific research and the importance she placed on the intersection of science and everyday life."
