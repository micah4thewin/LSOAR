He lived in ancient India during the 5th century BCE and his teachings have had a profound impact on millions of people around the world. This article will explore the life, teachings, and historical context of Buddha.\n\n## Key Terms\n- Buddhism: A religion and philosophy based on the teachings of Buddha.\n- Enlightenment: The state of awakening and understanding the true nature of reality.\n- Nirvana: The ultimate goal in Buddhism, representing the cessation of suffering and liberation from the cycle of rebirth.\n- Middle Way: The path of moderation and balance, avoiding extremes of self-indulgence and self-mortification.\n\n## Detailed Life\nBuddha was born into a royal family in present-day Nepal. At a young age, he was shielded from the harsh realities of life and was provided with a life of luxury and privilege. However, he grew disillusioned with his sheltered existence and embarked on a spiritual quest to seek the truth about human suffering and the nature of existence.\n\nAfter years of intense meditation and self-discipline, Buddha attained enlightenment under a Bodhi tree. He realized the Four Noble Truths, which form the foundation of Buddhist teachings. These truths state that suffering is inherent in life, the cause of suffering is desire and attachment, suffering can be overcome, and the path to overcoming suffering is the Eightfold Path.\n\nBuddha spent the rest of his life traveling and teaching his insights to others. He emphasized the importance of mindfulness, ethical conduct, and meditation in achieving liberation from suffering. His teachings attracted a large following, and Buddhism spread throughout India and eventually to other parts of Asia.\n\n## Little Known Facts\n- Buddha's original name was Siddhartha Gautama.\n- He was born into the Shakya clan, which belonged to the warrior caste.\n- Buddha's mother, Queen Maya, died shortly after giving birth to him.\n- He was married and had a son before renouncing his princely life.\n\n## Examples\nBuddha's teachings have had a profound impact on individuals and societies throughout history.

This principle has influenced the development of social welfare systems and the promotion of empathy in many cultures.\n\n- Non-attachment: Buddha taught that attachment to desires and material possessions leads to suffering.

The dominant religious and philosophical traditions of the time were Brahmanism and Jainism. Brahmanism emphasized ritualistic practices and the caste system, while Jainism focused on extreme asceticism.\n\nBuddha's teachings challenged the prevailing beliefs of his time.

It also gained royal patronage in various kingdoms, which helped in its dissemination.\n\n## Family-Friends\nBuddha's family consisted of his father, King Suddhodana, his mother, Queen Maya, and his wife, Yasodhara. He also had a son named Rahula. After renouncing his princely life, Buddha formed a close-knit community of followers known as the Sangha, which included both men and women.\n\n## Quotes\n- \"Do not dwell in the past, do not dream of the future, concentrate the mind on the present moment.\"\n- \"Peace comes from within.
