She is considered one of the most important artists of the 20th century and an icon of feminist art. Kahlo's unique style, characterized by vibrant colors and symbolic imagery, continues to inspire and captivate audiences worldwide.\n\n## Key Terms\n- Self-portraits: Paintings or drawings in which the artist depicts themselves.\n- Feminist art: Art that addresses and challenges the role of women in society.\n- Symbolism: The use of symbols to represent ideas or qualities.\n\n## Detailed Life\nFrida Kahlo was born on July 6, 1907, in Coyoacán, Mexico City. She grew up in a middle-class family and was influenced by her Mexican and indigenous heritage. Kahlo's life was marked by physical and emotional pain. At the age of six, she contracted polio, which left her with a limp. Later, at the age of 18, she was involved in a bus accident that caused severe injuries, including a broken spinal column, pelvis, and several other bones.\n\nDuring her recovery, Kahlo began to paint as a way to cope with her physical and emotional pain. She developed a unique style that combined elements of Mexican folk art, surrealism, and symbolism. Her self-portraits often depicted her physical and emotional suffering, as well as her Mexican identity.\n\nKahlo's art gained recognition both in Mexico and internationally. She had her first solo exhibition in Mexico City in 1953, shortly before her death in 1954 at the age of 47. Today, her artwork is celebrated for its raw honesty, powerful symbolism, and contribution to feminist art.\n\n## Little Known Facts\n- Frida Kahlo had a pet deer named Granizo, which she considered a symbol of tenderness and strength.\n- She had a tumultuous relationship with fellow artist Diego Rivera, whom she married and divorced multiple times.\n- Kahlo's art was not widely recognized during her lifetime, and she mainly gained international fame after her death.\n\n## Examples\nTo understand the relevance of Frida Kahlo's art, let's explore a few examples of her iconic paintings:\n\n1. \"The Two Fridas\" (1939): This painting depicts two versions of Frida Kahlo, one dressed in traditional Mexican clothing and the other in a Victorian-style dress.

It reflects the physical and emotional pain she endured throughout her life.\n\nThese examples demonstrate Kahlo's ability to create deeply personal and symbolic artworks that resonate with viewers on a universal level.\n\n## Historical Context\nFrida Kahlo lived during a time of significant political and social change in Mexico.
