She grew up in the royal court and received an education befitting a future ruler. When her father died, her half-brother Thutmose II ascended to the throne. However, he was young and sickly, so Hatshepsut served as his regent. \n\nAfter Thutmose II's death, Hatshepsut took the unprecedented step of declaring herself pharaoh, adopting the full regalia and titles of a male ruler. She presented herself as a legitimate pharaoh and sought to legitimize her rule through various means, including claiming divine birth and emphasizing her connection to the god Amun.\n\nHatshepsut's reign was marked by significant building projects, including the construction of her mortuary temple at Deir el-Bahari. She also launched several trading expeditions to the land of Punt, bringing back valuable resources and exotic goods. Under her rule, Egypt experienced a period of stability and prosperity.\n\n## Little Known Facts\n- Hatshepsut was often depicted in male attire, including the traditional pharaoh's kilt and false beard.\n- She was the stepmother of Thutmose III, who would later become one of Egypt's most successful pharaohs.\n- Hatshepsut's reign was largely peaceful, with few military campaigns recorded.\n\n## Examples\nTo showcase her authority and power, Hatshepsut commissioned the construction of her mortuary temple at Deir el-Bahari. This temple complex was designed to impress and inspire awe, with its terraced structure and intricate reliefs. It served as a monument to her reign and a place for religious rituals and offerings.\n\nHatshepsut's trading expeditions to the land of Punt were also significant examples of her reign. These expeditions brought back exotic goods such as incense, myrrh, and ebony, which were highly prized in ancient Egypt.
