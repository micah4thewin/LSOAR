She is known for her significant contributions to the development of computer programming languages and the popularization of high-level programming. Hopper was one of the first programmers of the Harvard Mark I computer and played a crucial role in the development of the COBOL programming language.\n\n## Key Terms\n- COBOL: Common Business-Oriented Language, a high-level programming language developed by Grace Hopper and her team.\n- Harvard Mark I: An early electromechanical computer developed at Harvard University, where Hopper worked as a programmer.\n- Rear Admiral: A high-ranking naval officer rank in the United States Navy.\n\n## Detailed Life\nGrace Hopper graduated from Vassar College in 1928 with a bachelor's degree in mathematics and physics. She then obtained her master's degree in mathematics from Yale University in 1930. Hopper began her career as a teacher but soon joined the United States Navy during World War II.\n\nDuring her time in the Navy, Hopper worked on the Harvard Mark I computer, where she became one of the first programmers. She developed the first compiler, known as the A-0 system, which translated mathematical code into machine-readable instructions. This innovation paved the way for the development of higher-level programming languages.\n\nIn the 1950s, Hopper worked on the UNIVAC I computer and played a significant role in the development of the COBOL programming language. COBOL became widely adopted and was instrumental in making computers more accessible to business applications.\n\nHopper continued to contribute to the field of computer science throughout her career. She served as a naval officer until her retirement in 1986, reaching the rank of rear admiral. Hopper received numerous awards and recognition for her work, including the National Medal of Technology and the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n\n## Little Known Facts\n- Grace Hopper coined the term \"bug\" to refer to a computer program error. The term originated from an incident where a moth caused a malfunction in the Harvard Mark II computer.\n- Hopper was the oldest serving officer in the United States military at the time of her retirement at the age of 79.\n\n## Examples\nGrace Hopper's contributions to computer programming have had a lasting impact. One example of her relevance is the development of COBOL. This programming language revolutionized business computing, allowing companies to automate their operations and handle large-scale data processing. COBOL is still used today in critical systems, such as banking and government applications.\n\nAnother example is Hopper's work on the A-0 system, the first compiler. This innovation enabled programmers to write code in a higher-level language, making it easier and more efficient to develop software. Compilers are now a fundamental component of modern programming languages.\n\n## Historical Context\nGrace Hopper's work took place during a pivotal time in the history of computing. In the mid-20th century, computers were transitioning from large, room-sized machines to more accessible and practical devices. Hopper's contributions played a crucial role in this development, making computers easier to program and opening up new possibilities for their use in various industries.\n\n## Questions and Answers\n1. Q: What is the significance of Grace Hopper's development of COBOL?\n   - A: COBOL revolutionized business computing by providing a high-level programming language specifically designed for business applications. It made it easier for non-technical professionals to write and understand computer programs, leading to increased efficiency and automation in the business sector.\n\n2. Q: How did Grace Hopper contribute to the field of computer programming?\n   - A: Hopper's contributions include developing the first compiler, popularizing high-level programming languages, and advocating for standardized programming practices. She played a vital role in making computers more accessible and user-friendly.\n\n## Family-Friends\nGrace Hopper never married and did not have children. However, she had a close relationship with her family and maintained friendships with many colleagues and fellow computer scientists throughout her career.\n\n## Quotes\n- \"The most dangerous phrase in the language is, 'We've always done it this way.'\"\n- \"A ship in port is safe, but that's not what ships are built for.\"\n- \"Humans are allergic to change. They love to say, 'We've always done it this way.' I try to fight that. That's why I have a clock on my wall that runs counter-clockwise.\""
