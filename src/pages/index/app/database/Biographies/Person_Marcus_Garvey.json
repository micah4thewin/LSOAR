Garvey's charismatic speeches and powerful rhetoric attracted a large following.\n\nOne of Garvey's most significant initiatives was the \"Back to Africa\" movement, which aimed to encourage African Americans to return to Africa and build a new nation. He believed that Africa was the rightful homeland of all black people and that they should reclaim their heritage and contribute to the development of the continent.\n\nHowever, Garvey faced opposition from various groups, including the U.S. government, which viewed his movement as a threat. In 1922, he was charged with mail fraud and sentenced to prison. After serving two years, Garvey was deported to Jamaica.
