At the age of 14, she was married off to Louis XVI of France in an attempt to strengthen the alliance between Austria and France. However, her arrival in France was met with hostility and suspicion from the French people.\n\nAs Queen of France, Marie Antoinette faced numerous challenges. She struggled to adapt to the rigid court etiquette and was criticized for her extravagant spending on fashion, parties, and personal luxuries. These actions earned her the nickname \"Madame Deficit\" and fueled public resentment towards the monarchy.\n\nDuring her time as queen, France faced economic hardships and political unrest.

This retreat allowed her to escape the formalities of court life and indulge in her own desires.\n\nAnother example is the infamous quote attributed to her during a time of food shortages when she allegedly said, \"Let them eat cake.\" This statement, although likely a misattribution, came to symbolize her perceived indifference towards the suffering of the French people.\n\n## Historical Context\nMarie Antoinette lived during a time of significant social and political change in France.
