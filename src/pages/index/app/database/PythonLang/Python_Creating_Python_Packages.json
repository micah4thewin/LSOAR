This documentation will guide you through the process of creating Python packages.\n\n### Objective and Scope\nThe objective of this documentation is to provide step-by-step instructions on how to create Python packages. It covers the necessary requirements and pre-requisites, provides code snippets and commands, troubleshoots common issues, and offers best practices and recommendations.\n\n### Requirements and Pre-requisites\nTo create Python packages, you need the following:\n- Python installed on your system.\n- A text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) to write your code.\n- Basic knowledge of Python programming.\n\n### Step-by-Step Instructions\n1. Create a new directory for your package. This will serve as the root directory for your package.\n2. Inside the root directory, create a new directory with the name of your package. This will be the package directory.\n3. Inside the package directory, create a file named `__init__.py`. This file is required for Python to recognize the directory as a package.\n4. Create your Python modules inside the package directory. These modules will contain the actual code for your package.\n5. Optionally, create a `setup.py` file in the root directory. This file is used to specify metadata about your package, such as its name, version, and dependencies.\n6. Test your package by importing it in another Python script or running its modules directly.\n\n### Code Snippets and Commands\nHere are some code snippets and commands that may be useful when creating Python packages:\n\n- To import a module from your package:\n```python\nfrom package_name import module_name\n```\n\n- To run a module directly:\n```bash\npython -m package_name.module_name\n```\n\n- To install your package using `setup.py`:\n```bash\npython setup.py install\n```\n\n### Troubleshooting and Common Issues\n- Issue: \"ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'package_name'\"\n  - Solution: Make sure the package directory has an `__init__.py` file and is located in the correct directory.\n\n- Issue: \"ImportError: No module named 'module_name'\"\n  - Solution: Double-check the module name and make sure it is spelled correctly.\n\n### Best Practices and Recommendations\n- Use meaningful names for your packages and modules to make them easier to understand and use.\n- Follow the Python naming conventions for packages, modules, and variables.\n- Document your code using comments and docstrings to make it easier for others to understand and use your package.\n\n### Summary and Conclusion\nCreating Python packages allows for better organization and sharing of code. By following the step-by-step instructions provided in this documentation, you can create your own Python packages and make your code more reusable and accessible to others. Remember to adhere to best practices and recommendations for optimal performance and maintainability."
