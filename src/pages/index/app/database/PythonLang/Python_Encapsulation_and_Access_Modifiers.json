It allows data to be hidden and accessed only through defined methods. Access modifiers, on the other hand, determine the visibility and accessibility of class members. Python provides different access modifiers to control the access to class attributes and methods.\n\n### Objective and Scope\nThe objective of this documentation is to provide a comprehensive guide on encapsulation and access modifiers in Python. It covers the concept of encapsulation, different access modifiers available in Python, and how to use them effectively.\n\n### Requirements and Pre-requisites\nTo follow along with this documentation, you need:\n- Python installed on your system\n- Basic understanding of object-oriented programming concepts\n\n### Step-by-Step Instructions\n1. Create a Python file and open it in your preferred code editor.\n2. Define a class and its attributes. For example:\n```python\nclass Employee:\n    def __init__(self, name, age):\n        self.name = name\n        self.age = age\n```\n3. By default, all attributes and methods in a class are public. Public attributes can be accessed from anywhere. For example:\n```python\nemployee = Employee(\"John\", 30)\nprint(employee.name)  # Output: John\n```\n4. To make an attribute private, prefix it with double underscores (`__`). Private attributes can only be accessed within the class. For example:\n```python\nclass Employee:\n    def __init__(self, name, age):\n        self.__name = name\n        self.__age = age\n\nemployee = Employee(\"John\", 30)\nprint(employee.__name)  # Raises an AttributeError\n```\n5. To access private attributes, create getter and setter methods within the class. For example:\n```python\nclass Employee:\n    def __init__(self, name, age):\n        self.__name = name\n        self.__age = age\n\n    def get_name(self):\n        return self.__name\n\n    def set_name(self, name):\n        self.__name = name\n\nemployee = Employee(\"John\", 30)\nprint(employee.get_name())  # Output: John\nemployee.set_name(\"Alice\")\nprint(employee.get_name())  # Output: Alice\n```\n6. Python does not enforce strict encapsulation like some other languages. Private attributes can still be accessed using name mangling. For example:\n```python\nemployee._Employee__name = \"Bob\"\nprint(employee.get_name())  # Output: Bob\n```\n7. To make an attribute protected, prefix it with a single underscore (`_`). Protected attributes can be accessed within the class and its subclasses. For example:\n```python\nclass Employee:\n    def __init__(self, name, age):\n        self._name = name\n        self._age = age\n\nclass Manager(Employee):\n    def __init__(self, name, age, department):\n        super().__init__(name, age)\n        self._department = department\n\nmanager = Manager(\"Alice\", 35, \"Sales\")\nprint(manager._name)  # Output: Alice\nprint(manager._department)  # Output: Sales\n```\n\n### Code Snippets and Commands\n- `class Employee:` - Defines a class named \"Employee\".\n- `def __init__(self, name, age):` - Defines the constructor method for the class.\n- `self.name = name` - Assigns the \"name\" parameter to the \"name\" attribute of the class.\n- `employee = Employee(\"John\", 30)` - Creates an instance of the \"Employee\" class.\n- `print(employee.name)` - Prints the value of the \"name\" attribute of the \"employee\" object.\n\n### Troubleshooting and Common Issues\n- If you encounter an `AttributeError` when trying to access a private attribute, make sure you are using the correct name mangling syntax (`_ClassName__attribute`).\n- Be cautious when using private and protected attributes, as they can still be accessed from outside the class if not used properly.\n\n### Best Practices and Recommendations\n- Use encapsulation and access modifiers to control the visibility and accessibility of class members.\n- Follow naming conventions to indicate the intended visibility of attributes and methods.\n- Avoid direct access to private attributes from outside the class, and use getter and setter methods instead.\n\n### Summary and Conclusion\nPython supports encapsulation and access modifiers through the use of private and protected attributes. By using these modifiers, you can control the visibility and accessibility of class members. Encapsulation helps in hiding the internal implementation details of a class and provides a clean interface for interacting with the class. Access modifiers allow you to define the level of access to class members, ensuring data integrity and security."
