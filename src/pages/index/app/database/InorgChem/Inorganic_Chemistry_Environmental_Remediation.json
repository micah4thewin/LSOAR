This branch of chemistry focuses on understanding the behavior of inorganic compounds and their interactions with contaminants. By harnessing the principles of inorganic chemistry, scientists and engineers can develop effective strategies to mitigate environmental pollution and protect ecosystems.\n\n## Key Concepts\n- Inorganic compounds: These are substances that lack carbon-hydrogen bonds and are typically derived from minerals or non-living matter.\n- Contaminants: These are substances that have harmful effects on the environment or living organisms. They can include heavy metals, radioactive materials, and various organic pollutants.\n- Redox reactions: Inorganic chemistry explores the transfer of electrons between different species, which is crucial in the breakdown and transformation of contaminants.\n- Coordination chemistry: This field studies the interactions between metal ions and other molecules, providing insights into the behavior of metal pollutants in the environment.\n- Adsorption and absorption: Inorganic materials can be used to adsorb or absorb contaminants, effectively removing them from the environment.\n\n## Practical Applications\nInorganic chemistry plays a vital role in various practical applications related to environmental remediation:\n- Water treatment: Inorganic compounds, such as activated carbon and zeolites, can be used to remove contaminants from water sources, ensuring safe drinking water.\n- Soil remediation: Inorganic materials, including metal oxides and clays, can be employed to immobilize
