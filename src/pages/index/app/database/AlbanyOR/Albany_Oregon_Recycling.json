Single-stream recycling means that all recyclable materials, such as paper, plastic, glass, and metal, can be placed in the same recycling bin. This eliminates the need for residents to sort their recyclables, making recycling more accessible and encouraging higher participation rates.\n\nOnce the recycling bins are collected, they are transported to a recycling facility. At the facility, the recyclables are sorted, processed, and prepared for reuse. This involves separating different materials and removing any contaminants. The sorted materials are then sent to manufacturers who use them to create new products.\n\nRecycling in Albany Oregon not only reduces the amount of waste going to landfills but also conserves natural resources.
