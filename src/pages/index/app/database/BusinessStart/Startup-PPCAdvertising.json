It involves bidding on keywords and placing advertisements on search engines or other platforms, paying only when a user clicks on the ad.\n\n## Key Terms\n- PPC (Pay-Per-Click): A form of online advertising where advertisers pay a fee each time their ad is clicked.\n- Keywords: Words or phrases that advertisers target to trigger their ads to appear in search engine results.\n- Ad Rank: A value that determines the position of an ad on a search engine results page based on factors like bid amount and ad quality score.\n- Quality Score: A metric used by search engines to measure the relevance and quality of an ad and its landing page.\n\n## Detailed Explanation\nStartup-PPCAdvertising works by allowing startups to create and display ads on search engines like Google or social media platforms like Facebook. These ads are triggered when users search for specific keywords or meet certain demographic criteria set by the advertiser. The startup sets a maximum bid they are willing to pay for each click on their ad.\n\nWhen a user searches for a keyword targeted by the startup, an auction takes place among advertisers who have bid on that keyword. The search engine or platform considers factors like bid amount, ad quality, and relevance to determine the ad's position on the search results page. If the startup's ad is clicked, they pay the bid amount.\n\nThe success of Startup-PPCAdvertising depends on selecting the right keywords and creating compelling ads that drive users to take action, such as making a purchase or filling out a contact form. Continuous monitoring and optimization of campaigns are essential to maximize return on investment (ROI).\n\n## Concepts\n- **PPC**: Pay-Per-Click advertising model where advertisers pay for each click on their ads.\n- **Keywords**: Words or phrases targeted by advertisers to trigger their ads.\n- **Ad Rank**: Determines the position of an ad based on bid amount and ad quality score.\n- **Quality Score**: Measures the relevance and quality of an ad and its landing page.\n\n## Examples\n1.
