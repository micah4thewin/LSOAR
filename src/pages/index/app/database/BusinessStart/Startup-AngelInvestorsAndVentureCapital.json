In return for their investment, they receive equity in the company.\n\n### Venture Capital\nVenture capital refers to investment funds that are managed by professional investors. These funds pool money from various sources, such as pension funds, endowments, and wealthy individuals. Venture capital firms invest in startups that have the potential for rapid growth and high returns.

Venture capitalists typically invest in later stages of a startup's growth, when it has demonstrated market traction and scalability.\n\n## Concepts\n- **Equity**: Startups offer equity to investors in exchange for their investment. Equity represents ownership interest in the company.\n- **Risk and Return**: Both angel investors and venture capitalists take on high-risk investments in the hopes of achieving significant returns if the startup succeeds.\n- **Mentorship and Guidance**: Angel investors and venture capitalists often provide valuable advice and guidance to founders, leveraging their experience and network to help the startup grow.\n- **Due Diligence**: Before investing, angel investors and venture capitalists conduct thorough due diligence to assess the startup's market potential, team, and financials.\n\n## Examples\n1.
