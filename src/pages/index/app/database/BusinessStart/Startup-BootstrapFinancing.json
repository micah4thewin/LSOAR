It is the capital injection that allows entrepreneurs to develop their business ideas, build a prototype, and launch their startup.\n\n## Key Terms\n- Startup: A newly established business venture with a unique product or service.\n- Bootstrap: To start a business with minimal external funding or resources.\n- Financing: The act of providing funds or capital to support a business.\n\n## Detailed Explanation\nStartup-Bootstrap Financing is a method of funding that relies on the entrepreneur's personal savings, credit cards, or small loans from family and friends. This approach allows startups to minimize their reliance on external investors and maintain control over their business.\n\nBootstrapping requires entrepreneurs to be resourceful and creative in finding ways to fund their startup. They often use their own money or personal assets to cover initial expenses, such as product development, marketing, and operational costs.\n\nBy bootstrapping, startups can avoid giving away equity or control of their business to investors. This gives them the freedom to make decisions independently and retain a larger share of the profits.\n\n## Concepts\n- **Bootstrapping:** Starting a business with minimal external funding or resources.\n- **Capital Injection:** The infusion of funds into a business to support its operations.\n- **Equity:** Ownership interest in a company, represented by shares or stock.\n- **Control:** The power to make decisions and influence the direction of a business.\n\n## Examples\n1.

As the business grows, she reinvests profits to hire additional developers and expand the company.\n\n2. John has an innovative idea for a mobile app. He raises a small amount of money from friends and family to hire a developer and launch a prototype.
