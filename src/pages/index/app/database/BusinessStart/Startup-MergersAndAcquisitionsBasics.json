The merger enables Startup C to offer a comprehensive suite of services to its clients, combining software development expertise with marketing capabilities. This synergy enhances the value proposition of both startups and expands their market reach.\n\n## Tips for Understanding\n- Understand the strategic rationale: Before diving into the details of mergers and acquisitions, it is essential to grasp the strategic reasons behind such deals.
