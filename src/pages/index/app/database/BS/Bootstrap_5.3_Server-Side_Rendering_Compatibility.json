Server-side rendering allows web pages to be rendered on the server before being sent to the client, improving performance and SEO.\n\n### Objective and Scope\nThe objective of this documentation is to guide developers on how to implement server-side rendering with Bootstrap 5.3. It covers the necessary requirements, step-by-step instructions, code snippets, troubleshooting tips, best practices, and recommendations.\n\n### Requirements and Pre-requisites\nTo implement server-side rendering with Bootstrap 5.3, you need the following:\n\n- Node.js installed on your system.\n- Angular Universal package installed in your Angular project.\n- Basic knowledge of AngularJS and server-side rendering concepts.\n\n### Step-by-Step Instructions\nFollow these steps to achieve server-side rendering compatibility with Bootstrap 5.3:\n\n1. Install Angular Universal package by running the following command in your project directory:\n   ```\n   npm install @nguniversal/express-engine\n   ```\n\n2. Create a server.ts file in the root of your Angular project and add the following code:\n   ```typescript\n   import 'zone.js/dist/zone-node';\n   import { enableProdMode } from '@angular/core';\n   import { ngExpressEngine } from '@nguniversal/express-engine';\n   import * as express from 'express';\n   import { join } from 'path';\n   import { AppServerModule } from './src/main.server';\n\n   enableProdMode();\n\n   const app = express();\n   const port = process.env.PORT || 4000;\n   const distFolder = join(process.cwd(), 'dist/browser');\n   const indexHtml = join(distFolder, 'index.html');\n\n   app.engine('html', ngExpressEngine({\n     bootstrap: AppServerModule,\n   }));\n\n   app.set('view engine', 'html');\n   app.set('views', distFolder);\n\n   app.get('*.*', express.static(distFolder, {\n     maxAge: '1y'\n   }));\n\n   app.get('*', (req, res) => {\n     res.render(indexHtml, { req });\n   });\n\n   app.listen(port, () => {\n     console.log(`Server listening on port ${port}`);\n   });\n   ```\n\n3. Modify your package.json file to include the following scripts:\n   ```json\n   \"scripts\": {\n     \"build:ssr\": \"ng build --prod && ng run your-project-name:server:production\",\n     \"serve:ssr\": \"node dist/your-project-name/server/main.js\",\n     \"build-and-serve:ssr\": \"npm run build:ssr && npm run serve:ssr\"\n   }\n   ```\n\n4. Build your project for server-side rendering by running the following command:\n   ```\n   npm run build:ssr\n   ```\n\n5. Start the server to test the server-side rendering by running the following command:\n   ```\n   npm run serve:ssr\n   ```\n\n### Code Snippets and Commands\n- Install Angular Universal package:\n  ```\n  npm install @nguniversal/express-engine\n  ```\n\n- Build project for server-side rendering:\n  ```\n  npm run build:ssr\n  ```\n\n- Start the server for server-side rendering:\n  ```\n  npm run serve:ssr\n  ```\n\n### Troubleshooting and Common Issues\n- If you encounter any errors during the installation of Angular Universal package, make sure you have Node.js installed and try running the command with administrative privileges.\n\n- If the server fails to start or the rendered page does not display as expected, check your code for any errors or misconfigurations. Ensure that your Angular project is compatible with Angular Universal.\n\n### Best Practices and Recommendations\n- Keep your Angular project up to date with the latest version of Angular Universal to ensure compatibility with Bootstrap 5.3.\n\n- Optimize your server-side rendering configuration for improved performance. Minimize unnecessary server-side rendering to reduce server load.\n\n- Follow Angular and Bootstrap best practices to ensure clean and maintainable code.\n\n### Summary and Conclusion\nServer-side rendering compatibility with Bootstrap 5.3 allows for improved performance and SEO. By following the step-by-step instructions provided in this documentation, developers can easily implement server-side rendering in their Angular projects. Remember to follow best practices and recommendations for optimal results."
