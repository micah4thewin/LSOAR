Within the container, you can add rows and columns to create a responsive layout. Here's an example of a row with two columns:\n   ```html\n   <div class=\"container\">\n     <div class=\"row\">\n       <div class=\"col-sm-6\">\n         <!-- First column content -->\n       </div>\n       <div class=\"col-sm-6\">\n         <!-- Second column content -->\n       </div>\n     </div>\n   </div>\n   ```\n5. Save your HTML file and open it in a web browser to see the container and its content.\n\n### Code Snippets and Commands\n- To include Bootstrap CSS in your HTML file, add the following code to the `<head>` section:\n  ```html\n  <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.0/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css\">\n  ```\n- To create a container, use the following code:\n  ```html\n  <div class=\"container\">\n    <!-- Your content goes here -->\n  </div>\n  ```\n- To create a row with columns, use the following code:\n  ```html\n  <div class=\"container\">\n    <div class=\"row\">\n      <div class=\"col-sm-6\">\n        <!-- First column content -->\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"col-sm-6\">\n        <!-- Second column content -->\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  ```\n\n### Troubleshooting and Common Issues\n- Make sure you have included the Bootstrap CSS file correctly in your HTML file.\n- Check for any typos or syntax errors in your code.\n- Ensure that you have a valid DOCTYPE declaration at the beginning of your HTML file.\n\n### Best Practices and Recommendations\n- Use containers to wrap your content and provide a consistent layout.\n- Use rows and columns to create responsive and mobile-friendly designs.\n- Avoid nesting containers within each other, as it can cause layout issues.\n\n### Summary and Conclusion\nUsing containers in Bootstrap 5.3 allows you to create responsive and mobile-first websites with ease.
