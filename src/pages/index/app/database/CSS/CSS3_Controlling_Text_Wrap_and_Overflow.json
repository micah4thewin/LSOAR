  "article": "## CSS3: Controlling Text Wrap and Overflow\n\n### Introduction\nCSS3 provides powerful features for controlling how text wraps and overflows within an element. This allows web developers to have more control over the layout and presentation of text on their web pages. In this documentation, we will explore various techniques and properties available in CSS3 to achieve desired text wrap and overflow behavior.\n\n### Objective and Scope\nThe objective of this documentation is to provide a comprehensive guide on how to control text wrap and overflow using CSS3. The scope of this documentation includes explaining the concepts, providing step-by-step instructions, code snippets, troubleshooting tips, best practices, and recommendations.\n\n### Requirements and Pre-requisites\nTo follow along with this documentation, you will need a basic understanding of HTML and CSS. You will also need a text editor to write your CSS code and a web browser to view the results.\n\n### Step-by-Step Instructions\n1. **Controlling Text Wrap**: CSS3 provides several properties to control how text wraps within an element. Here are some commonly used properties:\n   - `word-wrap`: This property allows long words to be broken and wrapped onto the next line. It accepts values like `normal`, `break-word`, and `initial`.\n   - `white-space`: This property controls how white space characters are handled within an element. Values like `normal`, `nowrap`, and `pre` can be used to control text wrapping.\n   - `overflow-wrap`: This property controls how words should be wrapped when they extend beyond the boundaries of their container. Values like `normal` and `break-word` can be used to control text wrapping behavior.\n\n2. **Controlling Text Overflow**: CSS3 also provides properties to control how text overflows within an element. Here are some commonly used properties:\n   - `text-overflow`: This property specifies how to handle text overflow when it exceeds the width of its container. Values like `clip`, `ellipsis`, and `initial` can be used to control text overflow behavior.\n   - `overflow`: This property specifies how to handle content that overflows the boundaries of its container. Values like `visible`, `hidden`, `scroll`, and `auto` can be used to control overflow behavior.\n\n### Code Snippets and Commands\nHere are some code snippets that demonstrate the usage of CSS3 properties for controlling text wrap and overflow:\n\n```css\n/* Example 1: Controlling Text Wrap */\np {\n  word-wrap: break-word;\n  white-space: normal;\n  overflow-wrap: normal;\n}\n\n/* Example 2: Controlling Text Overflow */\np {\n  text-overflow: ellipsis;\n  overflow: hidden;\n}\n```\n\n### Troubleshooting and Common Issues\n- If the text is not wrapping as expected, make sure that the element has a defined width. Text wrapping requires a width constraint to work properly.\n- If the text is overflowing despite using overflow properties, check if the parent element has a defined width or if there are any conflicting CSS rules that may be affecting the overflow behavior.\n\n### Best Practices and Recommendations\n- Use responsive design techniques to ensure that text wrapping and overflow behavior adapt well to different screen sizes and devices.\n- Test your text wrap and overflow configurations on different browsers and devices to ensure consistent behavior.\n\n### Summary and Conclusion\nControlling text wrap and overflow is an important aspect of web design. With CSS3, you have several properties at your disposal to achieve the desired text wrapping and overflow behavior. By following the instructions, code snippets, and best practices provided in this documentation, you can effectively control how text is wrapped and displayed on your web pages."
