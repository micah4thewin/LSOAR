This feature is particularly useful for creating responsive designs that adapt to different devices and screen sizes.\n\n### Objective and Scope\nThe objective of this documentation is to provide a comprehensive guide on how to use advanced media queries in CSS3. This guide will cover the syntax and usage of media queries, as well as provide examples and best practices for effective implementation.\n\n### Requirements and Pre-requisites\nTo follow along with this guide, you will need:\n- A text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) for writing CSS code.\n- A modern web browser that supports CSS3.\n\n### Step-by-Step Instructions\n1. Open your preferred text editor or IDE.\n2. Create a new CSS file or open an existing one.\n3. To apply styles based on the width of the viewport, use the `@media` rule followed by the `min-width` or `max-width` property. For example:\n\n   ```css\n   @media (min-width: 768px) {\n     /* Styles applied when the viewport width is at least 768 pixels */\n   }\n   \n   @media (max-width: 1024px) {\n     /* Styles applied when the viewport width is less than or equal to 1024 pixels */\n   }\n   ```\n\n4. To apply styles based on the height of the viewport, use the `min-height` or `max-height` property within the `@media` rule. For example:\n\n   ```css\n   @media (min-height: 600px) {\n     /* Styles applied when the viewport height is at least 600 pixels */\n   }\n   \n   @media (max-height: 800px) {\n     /* Styles applied when the viewport height is less than or equal to 800 pixels */\n   }\n   ```\n\n5. To apply styles based on the device orientation, use the `orientation` property within the `@media` rule. For example:\n\n   ```css\n   @media (orientation: landscape) {\n     /* Styles applied when the device is in landscape orientation */\n   }\n   \n   @media (orientation: portrait) {\n     /* Styles applied when the device is in portrait orientation */\n   }\n   ```\n\n6. To apply styles based on the device resolution, use the `min-resolution` or `max-resolution` property within the `@media` rule. For example:\n\n   ```css\n   @media (min-resolution: 300dpi) {\n     /* Styles applied when the device resolution is at least 300 dots per inch */\n   }\n   \n   @media (max-resolution: 72dpi) {\n     /* Styles applied when the device resolution is less than or equal to 72 dots per inch */\n   }\n   ```\n\n7. Save your CSS file and link it to your HTML document using the `<link>` tag.\n\n### Code Snippets and Commands\n- `@media (min-width: 768px)`: Applies styles when the viewport width is at least 768 pixels.\n- `@media (max-width: 1024px)`: Applies styles when the viewport width is less than or equal to 1024 pixels.\n- `@media (min-height: 600px)`: Applies styles when the viewport height is at least 600 pixels.\n- `@media (max-height: 800px)`: Applies styles when the viewport height is less than or equal to 800 pixels.\n- `@media (orientation: landscape)`: Applies styles when the device is in landscape orientation.\n- `@media (orientation: portrait)`: Applies styles when the device is in portrait orientation.\n- `@media (min-resolution: 300dpi)`: Applies styles when the device resolution is at least 300 dots per inch.\n- `@media (max-resolution: 72dpi)`: Applies styles when the device resolution is less than or equal to 72 dots per inch.\n\n### Troubleshooting and Common Issues\n- Make sure your CSS file is properly linked to your HTML document.\n- Check that your media queries are written correctly and have the desired conditions.\n- Test your responsive design on different devices and screen sizes to ensure it behaves as expected.\n\n### Best Practices and Recommendations\n- Use relative units (such as percentages or em) instead of fixed units (such as pixels) for better responsiveness.\n- Prioritize mobile-first design by applying styles for smaller viewports first and then progressively enhancing for larger viewports.\n- Test your responsive design on real devices or using browser developer tools to ensure optimal user experience.\n\n### Summary and Conclusion\nCSS3 advanced media queries provide powerful tools for creating responsive designs that adapt to different devices and screen sizes. By using media queries, you can apply specific styles based on the viewport width, height, device orientation, and resolution. This documentation has provided step-by-step instructions, code snippets, troubleshooting tips, and best practices to help you effectively use advanced media queries in CSS3."
