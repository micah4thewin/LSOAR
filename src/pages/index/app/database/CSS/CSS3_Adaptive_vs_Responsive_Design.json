With CSS3, designers have more flexibility and control over the appearance of their web pages. Two popular design approaches in CSS3 are adaptive and responsive design. In this documentation, we will explore the differences between adaptive and responsive design and how to implement them using CSS3.\n\n### Objective and Scope\nThe objective of this documentation is to provide a clear understanding of adaptive and responsive design in CSS3 and guide developers in implementing these design approaches effectively. The scope of this documentation includes an overview of adaptive and responsive design, requirements and pre-requisites, step-by-step instructions, code snippets and commands, troubleshooting and common issues, best practices and recommendations, and a summary and conclusion.\n\n### Requirements and Pre-requisites\nTo implement adaptive and responsive design using CSS3, you will need the following:\n\n- Basic knowledge of HTML and CSS\n- A text editor or integrated development environment (IDE)\n- A web browser for testing and previewing your web pages\n\n### Step-by-Step Instructions\n1. Start by understanding the difference between adaptive and responsive design.\n2. Decide which design approach is suitable for your project based on its requirements and target audience.\n3. Plan the layout and structure of your web pages.\n4. Use media queries in your CSS code to make your design adaptive or responsive.\n5. Test and preview your web pages in different devices and screen sizes to ensure they look and function correctly.\n\n### Code Snippets and Commands\nHere are some code snippets and commands you can use when implementing adaptive and responsive design using CSS3:\n\n- Media query syntax:\n  ```css\n  @media screen and (max-width: 600px) {\n    /* CSS rules for screens with a maximum width of 600px */\n  }\n  ```\n\n- Responsive image:\n  ```css\n  img {\n    max-width: 100%;\n    height: auto;\n  }\n  ```\n\n- Adaptive layout using CSS grid:\n  ```css\n  .container {\n    display: grid;\n    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(200px, 1fr));\n    grid-gap: 20px;\n  }\n  ```\n\n### Troubleshooting and Common Issues\n- Make sure your media queries are written correctly and target the desired screen sizes.\n- Test your web pages on different devices and screen sizes to identify any layout or functionality issues.\n- Check for any conflicting CSS rules that may affect the adaptive or responsive design.\n\n### Best Practices and Recommendations\n- Use a mobile-first approach when designing responsive web pages.\n- Optimize your images and media files for faster loading times.\n- Test your web pages on multiple browsers to ensure cross-browser compatibility.\n- Use CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Foundation to simplify the implementation of adaptive and responsive design.\n\n### Summary and Conclusion\nIn this documentation, we discussed the differences between adaptive and responsive design in CSS3. We also provided step-by-step instructions, code snippets, troubleshooting tips, and best practices for implementing adaptive and responsive design. By understanding and utilizing these design approaches, you can create web pages that adapt and respond to different devices and screen sizes, providing a better user experience for your audience."
