They provide a way to control how properties are read and written, adding an extra layer of abstraction and encapsulation.\n\n### Objective and Scope\nThe objective of this documentation is to provide a thorough understanding of JavaScript Getters and Setters and how to use them effectively. It covers the basic concepts, syntax, and usage examples.\n\n### Requirements and Pre-requisites\nTo follow along with the examples and code snippets in this documentation, you should have a basic understanding of JavaScript and ES6 syntax. You will need a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) to write and run JavaScript code.\n\n### Step-by-Step Instructions\n1. Define a Getter:\n   - To define a getter for a property, use the `get` keyword followed by the property name.\n   - Inside the getter function, return the desired value for the property.\n   - Example:\n     ```javascript\n     const obj = {\n       get property() {\n         return 'getter value';\n       }\n     };\n     \n     console.log(obj.property); // Output: 'getter value'\n     ```\n\n2. Define a Setter:\n   - To define a setter for a property, use the `set` keyword followed by the property name.\n   - Inside the setter function, specify a parameter to represent the new value being assigned to the property.\n   - Example:\n     ```javascript\n     const obj = {\n       _property: '',\n       set property(value) {\n         this._property = value;\n       }\n     };\n     \n     obj.property = 'setter value';\n     console.log(obj._property); // Output: 'setter value'\n     ```\n\n3. Using Getters and Setters with Classes:\n   - Getters and setters can also be used with classes in JavaScript.\n   - Example:\n     ```javascript\n     class MyClass {\n       constructor() {\n         this._property = '';\n       }\n       \n       get property() {\n         return this._property;\n       }\n       \n       set property(value) {\n         this._property = value;\n       }\n     }\n     \n     const obj = new MyClass();\n     obj.property = 'class setter value';\n     console.log(obj.property); // Output: 'class setter value'\n     ```\n\n### Code Snippets and Examples\n- Getters and Setters can be used to perform additional logic or calculations when accessing or modifying properties.\n- Example:\n  ```javascript\n  const obj = {\n    _property: '',\n    get property() {\n      return this._property.toUpperCase();\n    },\n    set property(value) {\n      this._property = value.toLowerCase();\n    }\n  };\n  \n  obj.property = 'HELLO';\n  console.log(obj.property); // Output: 'hello'\n  ```\n\n### Troubleshooting and Common Issues\n- Make sure to use the correct syntax for defining getters and setters.\n- Check for any typos or syntax errors in your code.\n- Ensure that you are accessing the property correctly when using getters and setters.\n\n### Best Practices and Recommendations\n- Use getters and setters to enforce data validation and encapsulation.\n- Avoid using getters and setters for performance-critical operations, as they introduce additional overhead.\n- Be mindful of the naming conventions for getters and setters to avoid confusion.\n\n### Summary and Conclusion\nJavaScript Getters and Setters provide a way to define custom behavior for accessing and modifying object properties. They allow you to add an extra layer of abstraction and encapsulation to your code. By using getters and setters, you can control how properties are read and written, perform additional logic or calculations, and enforce data validation. Understanding and effectively using getters and setters can improve the maintainability and readability of your JavaScript code."
