It is a lean and flavorful cut of meat that is easy to prepare and makes a delicious centerpiece for any meal. This recipe will guide you through the steps to achieve a juicy and tender turkey breast with a crispy golden skin.\n\n## Ingredients\n- 1 turkey breast, bone-in and skin-on (approximately 3-4 pounds)\n- 2 tablespoons olive oil\n- 2 teaspoons dried herbs (such as thyme, rosemary, or sage)\n- 1 teaspoon garlic powder\n- 1 teaspoon onion powder\n- 1 teaspoon salt\n- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper\n\n## Equipment\n- Roasting pan\n- Meat thermometer\n- Basting brush\n- Aluminum foil\n\n## Preparation Time\n- 10 minutes\n\n## Cooking Time\n- Approximately 2 hours\n\n## Steps\n1. Preheat your oven to 325째F (163째C).\n2. Rinse the turkey breast under cold water and pat it dry with paper towels.\n3. In a small bowl, combine the dried herbs, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and black pepper to create a seasoning blend.\n4. Rub the olive oil all over the turkey breast, ensuring it is evenly coated.\n5. Sprinkle the seasoning blend over the turkey breast, rubbing it into the skin and meat.\n6. Place the turkey breast, skin-side up, in a roasting pan.\n7. Insert a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the turkey breast, making sure it does not touch the bone.\n8. Cover the roasting pan loosely with aluminum foil, leaving a small opening for steam to escape.\n9. Roast the turkey breast in the preheated oven for approximately 1 hour and 30 minutes.\n10. Remove the foil and continue roasting for another 30 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 165째F (74째C) on the meat thermometer.\n11. Once cooked, remove the turkey breast from the oven and let it rest for 15 minutes before slicing.\n\n## Serving Suggestions\n- Serve the oven roasted turkey breast as the main dish for a festive meal.\n- Pair it with traditional sides like mashed potatoes, roasted vegetables, and cranberry sauce.\n- Slice the turkey breast and use it in sandwiches or salads for a delicious leftover meal.\n\n## Variations\n- For a citrus twist, squeeze the juice of one lemon or orange over the turkey breast before roasting.\n- Add a touch of sweetness by brushing the turkey breast with maple syrup or honey during the last 15 minutes of cooking.\n\n## Tips and Tricks\n- Using a meat thermometer is essential to ensure the turkey breast is cooked to the correct internal temperature and remains juicy.\n- Letting the turkey breast rest after cooking allows the juices to redistribute, resulting in a more flavorful and tender meat.\n- If the skin is not crispy enough, you can broil the turkey breast for a few minutes at the end of cooking, keeping a close eye to prevent burning.\n\n## Nutritional Information\n- The nutritional information may vary depending on the size of the turkey breast and the specific ingredients used.
