This recipe uses an Instapot to quickly cook the butternut squash, resulting in a creamy and flavorful soup. The soup is naturally sweet and pairs well with a variety of toppings and sides.\n\n## Ingredients\n- 1 medium-sized butternut squash, peeled, seeded, and cubed\n- 1 onion, diced\n- 2 cloves of garlic, minced\n- 1 carrot, peeled and chopped\n- 1 apple, peeled, cored, and chopped\n- 4 cups vegetable broth\n- 1 teaspoon dried thyme\n- 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon\n- 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg\n- Salt and pepper to taste\n- Optional toppings: croutons, roasted pumpkin seeds, chopped fresh herbs\n\n## Equipment\n- Instapot or pressure cooker\n- Blender or immersion blender\n- Cutting board\n- Knife\n- Measuring cups and spoons\n- Wooden spoon or spatula\n\n## Preparation Time\n- 15 minutes\n\n## Cooking Time\n- 15 minutes (plus time for the Instapot to come to pressure)\n\n## Steps\n1. Place the cubed butternut squash, diced onion, minced garlic, chopped carrot, chopped apple, vegetable broth, dried thyme, ground cinnamon, and ground nutmeg in the Instapot.\n2. Close the lid and set the Instapot to manual high pressure for 15 minutes.\n3. Once the cooking time is complete, allow the pressure to naturally release for 10 minutes, then carefully release any remaining pressure.\n4. Use an immersion blender or transfer the soup to a blender to puree until smooth and creamy. Be cautious when blending hot liquids.\n5. Season the soup with salt and pepper to taste.\n6. Serve the soup hot, garnished with your choice of toppings such as croutons, roasted pumpkin seeds, or chopped fresh herbs.\n\n## Serving Suggestions\n- Serve the butternut squash soup as a comforting meal on its own, accompanied by crusty bread or a side salad.\n- Pair the soup with a grilled cheese sandwich for a classic and satisfying combination.\n- Serve the soup as an appetizer or part of a multi-course meal.\n\n## Variations\n- For a creamier soup, add a splash of heavy cream or coconut milk before blending.\n- Add a kick of heat by incorporating a pinch of cayenne pepper or red pepper flakes.\n- Enhance the flavor by roasting the butternut squash, onion, garlic, and carrot in the oven before adding them to the Instapot.\n- Experiment with different spices and herbs such as curry powder, paprika, or fresh sage.\n\n## Tips and Tricks\n- To easily peel and cube the butternut squash, cut off the ends, then use a vegetable peeler to remove the skin. Cut the squash in half lengthwise, scoop out the seeds, and then cut into cubes.\n- If you don't have an Instapot, you can still make this soup on the stovetop. Simply simmer the ingredients in a large pot until the butternut squash is tender, then blend until smooth.\n- Adjust the consistency of the soup by adding more vegetable broth if desired.\n- Leftover soup can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 4 days or frozen for longer storage.\n\n## Nutritional Information\n- The nutritional information may vary based on specific ingredients used and any optional toppings added.
