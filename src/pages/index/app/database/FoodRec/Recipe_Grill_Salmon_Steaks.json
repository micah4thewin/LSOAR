This recipe highlights the natural flavors of fresh salmon and adds a smoky char from grilling. It is a versatile dish that can be enjoyed on its own or paired with various sides.\n\n## Ingredients\n- 4 salmon steaks (6-8 ounces each)\n- 2 tablespoons olive oil\n- 2 tablespoons lemon juice\n- 2 cloves garlic, minced\n- 1 teaspoon dried dill\n- Salt and pepper, to taste\n\n## Equipment\n- Grill (gas or charcoal)\n- Tongs\n- Basting brush\n- Aluminum foil\n\n## Preparation Time\n- 10 minutes\n\n## Cooking Time\n- 10-12 minutes\n\n## Steps\n1. Preheat the grill to medium-high heat.\n2. In a small bowl, combine the olive oil, lemon juice, minced garlic, dried dill, salt, and pepper. Mix well to create a marinade.\n3. Place the salmon steaks in a shallow dish and pour the marinade over them. Ensure that the steaks are evenly coated. Let them marinate for about 10 minutes.\n4. While the salmon is marinating, prepare the grill by cleaning the grates and oiling them to prevent sticking.\n5. Once the grill is hot and the salmon has marinated, remove the salmon steaks from the marinade, allowing any excess marinade to drip off.\n6. Place the salmon steaks on the grill, skin side down. Close the grill lid and cook for 5-6 minutes.\n7. Carefully flip the salmon steaks using tongs and cook for an additional 4-6 minutes, or until the salmon is cooked through and flakes easily with a fork.\n8. During the last few minutes of cooking, baste the salmon with any remaining marinade using a basting brush.\n9. Once cooked, remove the salmon steaks from the grill and let them rest for a few minutes before serving.\n\n## Serving Suggestions\n- Serve the grilled salmon steaks with a side of roasted vegetables and a fresh salad.\n- Pair it with a lemon-dill sauce or a tangy mango salsa for added flavor.\n- Serve alongside a bed of quinoa or couscous for a complete meal.\n\n## Variations\n- For a citrus twist, substitute the lemon juice with orange or lime juice.\n- Add a kick of spice by sprinkling chili powder or cayenne pepper on the salmon before grilling.\n- Experiment with different herbs and spices, such as thyme, rosemary, or paprika, to enhance the flavor profile.\n\n## Tips and Tricks\n- Make sure the grill grates are clean and well-oiled to prevent the salmon from sticking.\n- If using a charcoal grill, ensure that the coals are evenly distributed and at the correct temperature before placing the salmon on the grill.\n- Avoid overcooking the salmon as it can result in a dry and tough texture. Cook until the salmon flakes easily with a fork.\n- Allow the salmon steaks to rest for a few minutes before serving to allow the juices to redistribute and enhance the flavor.\n\n## Nutritional Information\n- Serving Size: 1 salmon steak (6-8 ounces)\n- Calories: 350\n- Total Fat: 20g\n- Saturated Fat: 3.5g\n- Cholesterol: 100mg\n- Sodium: 150mg\n- Protein: 40g\n\n## Storage and Leftovers\n- If you have any leftovers, store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 days.\n- To reheat, gently warm the salmon in a skillet over low heat or enjoy it cold in salads or sandwiches.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\nQ: Can I use frozen salmon for this recipe?\nA: Fresh salmon is recommended for the best flavor and texture.
