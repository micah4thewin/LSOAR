Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook according to package instructions until al dente. Drain the pasta in a colander and set aside.\n2. In the meantime, prepare the pesto sauce. In a food processor or blender, combine the basil leaves, garlic, pine nuts, and Parmesan cheese. Pulse until the ingredients are finely chopped.\n3. With the food processor or blender running, slowly drizzle in the olive oil until the mixture is smooth and well combined. Season with salt and pepper to taste.\n4. Transfer the cooked pasta back to the pot and add the pesto sauce. Stir well to coat the pasta evenly with the sauce.\n5. Place the pot over low heat and gently warm the pasta for a minute or two, stirring occasionally. Be careful not to overheat the pesto sauce as it may lose its vibrant green color.\n6.

This step enhances their nutty flavor.\n- If you prefer a smoother sauce, blend the pesto for a longer time until it reaches your desired consistency.\n- Reserve a small amount of pasta cooking water before draining. If the pasta seems dry after adding the pesto sauce, you can add a splash of the reserved pasta water to loosen it up.\n\n## Nutritional Information\n- The nutritional information for Stovetop Pesto Pasta may vary depending on the type of pasta used and the amount of pesto sauce added.
