In a mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, instant yeast, salt, and sugar.\n2. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and pour in the warm water and olive oil.\n3.

Shape the dough into a ball and place it back into the mixing bowl. Cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel and let it rest for 10 minutes.\n6. After resting, divide the dough into two equal portions. Take one portion and roll it out into a thin circle or desired shape using a rolling pin.\n7. Heat a non-stick skillet or frying pan over medium heat. Place the rolled-out dough onto the pan and cook for about 2 minutes until the bottom is lightly browned.\n8.

Feel free to experiment with different cheese blends to suit your taste preferences. Mozzarella, cheddar, and feta are popular choices.\n\n**Q: Can I freeze the pizza dough?**\nA: Yes, you can freeze the pizza dough after it has risen.
