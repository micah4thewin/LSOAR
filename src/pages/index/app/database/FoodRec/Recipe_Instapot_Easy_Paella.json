However, you can also serve it with a side salad or crusty bread to complement the flavors. For a more authentic Spanish experience, pair it with a glass of Sangria or a refreshing glass of Gazpacho.\n\n## Variations\n- Seafood Paella: Add shrimp, mussels, and calamari rings to the paella during the cooking process to create a flavorful seafood version.\n- Vegetarian Paella: Omit the chicken and add extra vegetables such as artichoke hearts, mushrooms, and zucchini to make a satisfying vegetarian paella.\n- Paella Valenciana: This is the traditional version of paella from the Valencia region of Spain. It typically includes rabbit, snails, and a variety of beans along with the rice and vegetables.\n\n## Tips and Tricks\n- Use Arborio rice or another short-grain rice variety to achieve the desired texture and creaminess in the paella.\n- Saffron is a key ingredient in paella, as it provides a distinctive flavor and beautiful golden color. If you don't have saffron threads, you can substitute with turmeric for a similar color.\n- Allow the paella to sit for a few minutes after cooking to allow the flavors to meld together.\n- Be cautious with the salt as the vegetable broth and canned tomatoes may already contain salt. Adjust the seasoning accordingly.\n\n## Nutritional Information\n- Calories: 320 per serving\n- Fat: 7g\n- Carbohydrates: 52g\n- Protein: 12g\n\n## Storage and Leftovers\nLeftover Instapot Easy Paella can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.
