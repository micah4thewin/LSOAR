They are fluffy, delicious, and versatile. Whether you prefer them plain or loaded with toppings, these pancakes are sure to satisfy your cravings.\n\n## Ingredients\n- 1 cup all-purpose flour\n- 2 tablespoons sugar\n- 1 teaspoon baking powder\n- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda\n- 1/4 teaspoon salt\n- 3/4 cup buttermilk\n- 1/4 cup milk\n- 1 large egg\n- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted\n- Additional butter or oil for greasing the pan\n\n**Note:** If you don't have buttermilk, you can make a substitute by adding 1 tablespoon of lemon juice or vinegar to 1 cup of milk and letting it sit for 5 minutes.\n\n## Equipment\n- Mixing bowl\n- Whisk or fork\n- Non-stick skillet or griddle\n- Spatula\n- Measuring cups and spoons\n\n## Preparation Time\n- 10 minutes\n\n## Cooking Time\n- 15 minutes\n\n## Steps\n1. In a mixing bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Mix well.\n2. In a separate bowl, whisk together the buttermilk, milk, egg, and melted butter.\n3. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients. Stir until just combined. It's okay if the batter is slightly lumpy.\n4. Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat. Grease it with butter or oil.\n5. Scoop 1/4 cup of batter onto the skillet for each pancake. Cook until bubbles form on the surface, then flip and cook for another 1-2 minutes, or until golden brown.\n6. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter or oil to the skillet as needed.\n7. Serve the pancakes warm with your favorite toppings such as maple syrup, fresh fruits, whipped cream, or chocolate chips.\n\n## Serving Suggestions\n- Serve the pancakes with a drizzle of maple syrup and a pat of butter.\n- Top with fresh berries, sliced bananas, or chopped nuts for added flavor and texture.\n- Pair with crispy bacon or sausage for a savory-sweet breakfast combination.\n\n## Variations\n- Blueberry Pancakes: Add a handful of fresh or frozen blueberries to the batter before cooking.\n- Chocolate Chip Pancakes: Sprinkle chocolate chips onto each pancake after pouring the batter onto the skillet.\n- Banana Nut Pancakes: Mash a ripe banana and fold it into the batter along with some chopped nuts.\n- Cinnamon Pancakes: Mix 1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon into the dry ingredients for a warm and aromatic twist.\n\n## Tips and Tricks\n- Don't overmix the batter. Stir until the ingredients are just combined to avoid tough pancakes.\n- For fluffier pancakes, let the batter rest for 5 minutes before cooking. This allows the leavening agents to activate.\n- Adjust the heat as needed to prevent the pancakes from burning. Medium heat usually works well.\n- Keep the cooked pancakes warm by placing them on a baking sheet in a preheated oven at 200°F (93°C) while you finish cooking the rest.\n\n## Nutritional Information\n- The nutritional values may vary depending on the toppings used and the size of the pancakes.\n- Serving size: 1 pancake (without toppings)\n- Calories: 130\n- Fat: 5g\n- Carbohydrates: 17g\n- Protein: 4g\n\n## Storage and Leftovers\n- Stovetop Pancakes are best enjoyed fresh, but you can store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 days.\n- Reheat the pancakes in a toaster, microwave, or oven until warmed through before serving.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n**Q: Can I use whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose flour?**\nA: Yes, you can substitute whole wheat flour for all or part of the all-purpose flour. Keep in mind that the texture and flavor of the pancakes may be slightly different.\n\n**Q: Can I make the batter the night before and cook the pancakes in the morning?**\nA: It's best to make the batter right before cooking for optimal results. However, you can mix the dry and wet ingredients separately the night before and combine them in the morning.\n\n**Q: Can I freeze the cooked pancakes?**\nA: Yes, you can freeze the cooked pancakes. Place them in a single layer on a baking sheet and freeze until firm, then transfer them to a freezer-safe bag or container. To reheat, simply toast them in a toaster or warm them in the oven.\n\n**Q: Can I use a different type of milk, such as almond milk or soy milk?**\nA: Yes, you can use alternative milk options in place of regular milk. Keep in mind that the flavor and texture may vary slightly.\n\n**Q: Can I make mini pancakes instead of regular-sized ones?**\nA: Absolutely! Use a tablespoon or cookie scoop to portion out smaller amounts of batter onto the skillet. Adjust the cooking time accordingly."
