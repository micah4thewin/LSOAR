This dish is popular in many cuisines and is often served alongside roasted meats or as part of a vegetable medley. The roasting process enhances the sweetness of the asparagus while adding a slight char and crispness.\n\n## Ingredients\n- 1 bunch of asparagus (approximately 1 pound)\n- 2 tablespoons olive oil\n- 1 teaspoon salt\n- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper\n- Optional: grated Parmesan cheese for serving\n\n## Equipment\n- Baking sheet\n- Aluminum foil (optional)\n- Tongs or spatula\n\n## Preparation Time\n- 5 minutes\n\n## Cooking Time\n- 12-15 minutes\n\n## Steps\n1. Preheat the oven to 425째F (220째C).\n2. Wash the asparagus thoroughly and trim off the tough ends. You can do this by holding the asparagus spear at both ends and bending it until it snaps. Discard the tough end and keep the tender part.\n3. Place the asparagus spears on a baking sheet lined with aluminum foil for easy cleanup, or directly on a greased baking sheet.\n4. Drizzle the olive oil over the asparagus, making sure to coat each spear evenly.\n5. Sprinkle the salt and black pepper over the asparagus, again ensuring even distribution.\n6. Toss the asparagus gently with your hands or tongs to coat them thoroughly with the oil, salt, and pepper.\n7. Arrange the asparagus in a single layer on the baking sheet, making sure they are not overcrowded. This allows for even roasting.\n8. Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and roast for 12-15 minutes, or until the asparagus is tender and slightly charred. The cooking time may vary depending on the thickness of the asparagus spears, so keep an eye on them.\n9. Once the asparagus is cooked, remove the baking sheet from the oven and transfer the roasted asparagus to a serving platter.\n10. Optional: Sprinkle grated Parmesan cheese over the roasted asparagus for added flavor.\n11. Serve the oven roasted asparagus immediately while it's still hot.\n\n## Serving Suggestions\n- Oven roasted asparagus pairs well with grilled or roasted meats such as steak, chicken, or salmon.\n- It can also be served as a side dish alongside mashed potatoes or roasted potatoes.\n- For a lighter meal, serve the roasted asparagus with a fresh green salad or quinoa.\n\n## Variations\n- Lemon Garlic Asparagus: Add the zest of one lemon and 2 minced garlic cloves to the olive oil before drizzling it over the asparagus. This will give the dish a bright and tangy flavor.\n- Balsamic Glazed Asparagus: Drizzle balsamic glaze over the roasted asparagus just before serving for a sweet and tangy twist.\n- Prosciutto-Wrapped Asparagus: Wrap each asparagus spear with a slice of prosciutto before roasting for an indulgent appetizer or side dish.\n\n## Tips and Tricks\n- Choose fresh asparagus with firm stems and tight tips for the best flavor and texture.\n- If the asparagus spears are thick, you can peel the lower half of the stalks with a vegetable peeler to ensure even cooking.\n- Make sure to spread the asparagus out in a single layer on the baking sheet to allow for even roasting and prevent steaming.\n- Keep an eye on the asparagus while it's roasting to prevent it from becoming too soft or burnt.\n- For extra flavor, squeeze fresh lemon juice over the roasted asparagus just before serving.\n\n## Nutritional Information\n- The nutritional information for oven roasted asparagus (per serving of 1/4 pound) is as follows:\n  - Calories: 61\n  - Fat: 4.7g\n  - Carbohydrates: 4.9g\n  - Fiber: 2.5g\n  - Protein: 2.5g\n\n## Storage and Leftovers\n- Oven roasted asparagus is best enjoyed fresh.
