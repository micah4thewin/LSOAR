Made with lean ground turkey and cooked in an Instant Pot, these meatballs are flavorful, tender, and perfect for a quick and easy weeknight dinner.\n\n## Ingredients\n- 1 pound lean ground turkey\n- 1/2 cup breadcrumbs (can use gluten-free breadcrumbs as a substitute)\n- 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese\n- 1/4 cup finely chopped parsley\n- 1/4 cup finely chopped onion\n- 2 cloves garlic, minced\n- 1 egg, beaten\n- 1 teaspoon dried oregano\n- 1/2 teaspoon salt\n- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper\n- 1 cup marinara sauce\n\n## Equipment\n- Instant Pot or pressure cooker\n- Mixing bowl\n- Measuring cups and spoons\n- Wooden spoon or spatula\n- Baking sheet (optional)\n\n## Preparation Time\n- 15 minutes\n\n## Cooking Time\n- 10 minutes (plus additional time for the Instant Pot to come to pressure and release pressure)\n\n## Steps\n1. In a mixing bowl, combine the ground turkey, breadcrumbs, Parmesan cheese, parsley, onion, garlic, egg, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper. Mix well until all the ingredients are evenly incorporated.\n2. Shape the mixture into meatballs, about 1 inch in diameter. You should get approximately 24 meatballs.\n3. Preheat the Instant Pot by selecting the \"Saute\" function and setting it to medium heat. Once the Instant Pot is hot, add a small amount of cooking oil.\n4. Place the meatballs in the Instant Pot, making sure they are not overcrowded. You may need to cook them in batches depending on the size of your Instant Pot.\n5. Cook the meatballs for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until they are browned. This step helps to seal in the moisture and enhance the flavor of the meatballs.\n6. Once the meatballs are browned, pour the marinara sauce over them, making sure they are evenly coated.\n7. Secure the lid of the Instant Pot and set the valve to the sealing position.\n8. Select the \"Manual\" or \"Pressure Cook\" function and set the cooking time to 5 minutes on high pressure.\n9. After the cooking time is complete, allow the Instant Pot to naturally release the pressure for 5 minutes, then carefully switch the valve to the venting position to release any remaining pressure.\n10. Once the pressure has fully released, carefully open the lid of the Instant Pot.\n11. Serve the meatballs with marinara sauce over pasta, zucchini noodles, or as a sandwich filling.\n\n## Serving Suggestions\n- Serve the Instapot Turkey Meatballs over cooked pasta or zucchini noodles for a complete meal.\n- Pair the meatballs with a side salad or steamed vegetables for a balanced plate.\n- Use the meatballs as a filling for sandwiches or wraps for a quick and satisfying lunch.\n\n## Variations\n- For a spicy kick, add 1/2 teaspoon of red pepper flakes to the meatball mixture.\n- Substitute ground chicken or pork for the ground turkey for a different flavor profile.\n- Experiment with different herbs and spices, such as basil, thyme, or paprika, to customize the flavor of the meatballs.\n\n## Tips and Tricks\n- To prevent the meatballs from sticking to the Instant Pot, make sure to brown them well before adding the marinara sauce.\n- If you prefer a thicker sauce, remove the cooked meatballs from the Instant Pot and set it to the \"Saute\" function again. Cook the sauce until it thickens to your desired consistency before adding the meatballs back in.\n- Leftover meatballs can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days or frozen for up to 3 months.\n\n## Nutritional Information\n- Serving Size: 4 meatballs\n- Calories: 220\n- Total Fat: 9g\n- Saturated Fat: 3g\n- Cholesterol: 100mg\n- Sodium: 480mg\n- Total Carbohydrate: 10g\n- Dietary Fiber: 1g\n- Sugars: 3g\n- Protein: 24g\n\n## Storage and Leftovers\n- Leftover Instapot Turkey Meatballs can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.\n- To reheat, place the meatballs in a microwave-safe dish and heat on high for 1-2 minutes, or until heated through.\n- Alternatively, you can reheat the meatballs in a saucepan over low heat, stirring occasionally, until heated through.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\nQ: Can I use ground beef instead of ground turkey?\nA: Yes, you can substitute ground beef for the ground turkey in this recipe. Keep in mind that the nutritional information and cooking times may vary.\n\nQ: Can I make these meatballs in a slow cooker instead of an Instant Pot?\nA: Yes, you can cook the meatballs in a slow cooker. Follow the same steps for browning the meatballs in a skillet, then transfer them to a slow cooker. Cook on low for 4-6 hours or on high for 2-3 hours, adding the marinara sauce in the last hour of cooking.\n\nQ: Can I freeze the uncooked meatball mixture?\nA: Yes, you can shape the meatball mixture into balls and freeze them on a baking sheet. Once frozen, transfer the meatballs to a freezer-safe bag or container. When ready to cook, thaw the meatballs in the refrigerator overnight before cooking as directed."
