This creamy and hearty soup is made with simple ingredients like potatoes, leeks, onions, and broth. It is perfect for a cozy dinner or lunch during colder months.\n\n## Ingredients\n- 4 medium potatoes, peeled and diced\n- 2 leeks, white and light green parts only, thinly sliced\n- 1 onion, chopped\n- 2 cloves of garlic, minced\n- 4 cups vegetable or chicken broth\n- 1 cup heavy cream (substitute with coconut milk for a dairy-free option)\n- 2 tablespoons butter (substitute with olive oil for a vegan option)\n- Salt and pepper to taste\n- Optional toppings: chopped chives, crumbled bacon, grated cheese\n\n## Equipment\n- Large pot or Dutch oven\n- Wooden spoon or spatula\n- Immersion blender or regular blender\n- Soup bowls or mugs\n\n## Preparation Time\n- 15 minutes\n\n## Cooking Time\n- 30 minutes\n\n## Steps\n1. In a large pot or Dutch oven, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the chopped onion, sliced leeks, and minced garlic. Saut√© until the vegetables are softened and fragrant, about 5 minutes.\n\n2. Add the diced potatoes to the pot and season with salt and pepper. Stir to coat the potatoes with the butter and vegetable mixture.\n\n3. Pour in the vegetable or chicken broth and bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and let the soup simmer for about 20 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender when pierced with a fork.\n\n4. Using an immersion blender or regular blender, carefully puree the soup until smooth and creamy. If using a regular blender, work in batches and be cautious of hot liquid.\n\n5. Return the pureed soup to the pot and stir in the heavy cream (or coconut milk). Heat the soup over low heat until warmed through, but do not let it boil.\n\n6. Taste the soup and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper if needed.\n\n7. Ladle the Stovetop Potato Leek Soup into bowls or mugs. Garnish with optional toppings such as chopped chives, crumbled bacon, or grated cheese.\n\n8. Serve the soup hot and enjoy!\n\n## Serving Suggestions\n- Serve the Stovetop Potato Leek Soup as a main course with a side of crusty bread or a fresh salad.\n- Pair it with a grilled cheese sandwich for a comforting and satisfying meal.\n- Serve the soup in small portions as an appetizer or starter before a larger meal.\n\n## Variations\n- For a vegetarian version, use vegetable broth instead of chicken broth and omit the bacon topping.\n- Add cooked and crumbled bacon to the soup for extra flavor and texture.\n- Stir in a handful of fresh herbs such as thyme or parsley before serving for added freshness.\n- For a heartier version, add cooked diced chicken or ham to the soup.\n- Make it spicy by adding a pinch of cayenne pepper or a dash of hot sauce.\n\n## Tips and Tricks\n- Make sure to thoroughly clean the leeks as they can have dirt trapped between their layers. Slice them lengthwise and rinse under cold water to remove any grit.\n- If you prefer a chunkier soup, reserve some of the cooked potatoes before blending and add them back into the soup after pureeing.\n- Adjust the consistency of the soup by adding more broth or cream to reach your desired thickness.\n- Leftover soup can thicken when refrigerated.
