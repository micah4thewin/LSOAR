Preheat the oven to 400째F (200째C).\n2. In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil, lemon juice, minced garlic, dried dill, salt, and pepper.\n3. Place the salmon fillets in a baking dish and pour the marinade over them. Make sure the fillets are evenly coated.\n4. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil, sealing it tightly to create a steamy environment for the salmon.\n5. Bake the salmon in the preheated oven for 15-20 minutes, or until it is cooked through and flakes easily with a fork. The cooking time may vary depending on the thickness of the fillets.\n6. Remove the foil and broil the salmon for an additional 2-3 minutes to give it a slightly crispy top.\n7. Carefully transfer the salmon to serving plates and drizzle any remaining marinade over the top.\n8.

Keep a close eye on it during the last few minutes of baking.\n- Allow the salmon to rest for a few minutes after removing it from the oven. This helps the flavors to develop and the juices to redistribute.\n\n## Nutritional Information\n- The nutritional values may vary depending on the specific ingredients used and the size of the salmon fillets.
