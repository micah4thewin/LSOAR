Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C).\n2. Slice the eggplants into 1/4-inch thick rounds. Sprinkle salt on both sides of each slice and let them sit for 10 minutes to remove excess moisture. Pat dry with a paper towel.\n3. Set up three shallow bowls: one with flour, one with beaten eggs, and one with a mixture of breadcrumbs, grated Parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper.\n4. Dip each eggplant slice into the flour, shaking off any excess. Then dip it into the beaten eggs, allowing any excess to drip off. Finally, coat it in the breadcrumb mixture, pressing gently to adhere the breadcrumbs.\n5. Place the breaded eggplant slices on a greased baking sheet. Brush the tops with olive oil.\n6.
