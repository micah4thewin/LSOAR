Add the chicken wings to the bowl and toss them in the marinade until they are well coated.\n4. Place a wire rack on top of a baking sheet to allow air circulation and prevent the wings from getting soggy.\n5. Arrange the chicken wings on the wire rack in a single layer, leaving space between each wing.\n6. Bake the wings in the preheated oven for 45 minutes, or until they are golden brown and crispy.\n7.

Once cooked, remove the wings from the oven and let them cool for a few minutes before serving.\n\n## Serving Suggestions\n- Serve the oven-baked chicken wings as an appetizer with your favorite dipping sauces such as ranch, blue cheese, or barbecue sauce.\n- Pair them with celery sticks and carrot sticks for a refreshing and crunchy side.\n\n## Variations\n- Honey Mustard Wings: Add 2 tablespoons of honey and 1 tablespoon of Dijon mustard to the marinade for a sweet and tangy flavor.\n- Asian Glazed Wings: Replace the paprika and garlic powder with 1 tablespoon of soy sauce, 1 tablespoon of honey, and 1 teaspoon of sesame oil. Garnish with sesame seeds and chopped green onions before serving.\n\n## Tips and Tricks\n- Pat dry the chicken wings with paper towels before marinating them. This will help them get crispier in the oven.\n- For extra crispy wings, you can broil them for 1-2 minutes after baking.\n- If you prefer spicier wings, increase the amount of cayenne pepper in the marinade.\n- Make sure to leave enough space between the wings on the baking sheet to allow for even cooking.\n\n## Nutritional Information\n- The nutritional information provided is approximate and may vary depending on the specific ingredients used.\n- Serving Size: 4 wings\n- Calories: 240\n- Total Fat: 16g\n- Saturated Fat: 4g\n- Cholesterol: 94mg\n- Sodium: 616mg\n- Carbohydrates: 1g\n- Protein: 22g\n\n## Storage and Leftovers\n- Store any leftover oven-baked chicken wings in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.\n- To reheat, place the wings on a baking sheet and bake in a preheated oven at 350째F (175째C) for 10-15 minutes, or until heated through.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n- Can I use frozen chicken wings for this recipe?\n  - Yes, you can use frozen chicken wings.
