Serve the Crockpot Beef Bourguignon hot, garnished with the crispy bacon and fresh parsley.\n\n## Serving Suggestions\n- Crockpot Beef Bourguignon is traditionally served with crusty bread or mashed potatoes to soak up the flavorful sauce. You can also serve it with buttered noodles or steamed rice.\n- Pair this dish with a glass of red wine, such as Burgundy or Pinot Noir, to complement the flavors.\n\n## Variations\n- For a healthier version, you can use lean beef or substitute some of the beef with mushrooms to reduce the meat content.\n- Add pearl onions or frozen peas to the stew for additional flavor and texture.\n- Experiment with different herbs and spices, such as rosemary or thyme, to personalize the dish to your taste.\n\n## Tips and Tricks\n- For a richer flavor, marinate the beef overnight in red wine before cooking.\n- If you prefer a thicker sauce, mix 1 tablespoon of cornstarch with 2 tablespoons of water and stir it into the stew during the last 30 minutes of cooking.\n- If you don't have a crockpot, you can also cook this dish in a Dutch oven on the stovetop or in the oven at 325°F (163°C) for 2-3 hours.\n\n## Nutritional Information\n- Serving Size: 1 cup\n- Calories: 350\n- Total Fat: 15g\n- Saturated Fat: 5g\n- Cholesterol: 75mg\n- Sodium: 600mg\n- Carbohydrates: 10g\n- Fiber: 2g\n- Sugar: 3g\n- Protein: 30g\n\n## Storage and Leftovers\n- Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.\n- Crockpot Beef Bourguignon can also be frozen for up to 3 months.
