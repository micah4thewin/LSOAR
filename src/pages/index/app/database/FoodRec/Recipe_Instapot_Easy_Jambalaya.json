Turn on the Instant Pot and select the \"Sauté\" function. Heat the olive oil in the pot.\n2. Add the diced onion, green bell pepper, and celery. Sauté for 3-4 minutes, until the vegetables start to soften.\n3. Add the minced garlic and sauté for an additional 1 minute.\n4. Push the vegetables to one side of the pot and add the sliced smoked sausage. Cook for 2-3 minutes, until lightly browned.\n5. Add the chicken thighs to the pot and cook until they are no longer pink, about 5 minutes.\n6. Cancel the \"Sauté\" function and add the diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, rice, chicken broth, Cajun seasoning, dried thyme, dried oregano, paprika, cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper to the pot. Stir well to combine.\n7. Close the Instant Pot lid and set the valve to the \"Sealing\" position.\n8. Select the \"Pressure Cook\" or \"Manual\" function and set the cooking time to 5 minutes on high pressure.\n9. Once the cooking time is complete, allow the pressure to release naturally for 10 minutes, then carefully do a quick release of any remaining pressure.\n10. Open the Instant Pot lid and give the Jambalaya a good stir. Let it sit for a few minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.\n11. Serve the Jambalaya hot, garnished with freshly chopped parsley.\n\n## Serving Suggestions\n- Jambalaya is a complete meal on its own, but you can serve it with a side of cornbread or crusty French bread.\n- For a refreshing contrast, serve a simple green salad with a tangy vinaigrette alongside the Jambalaya.\n\n## Variations\n- Seafood Jambalaya: Replace the smoked sausage and chicken with shrimp, crawfish, or a combination of seafood. Add the seafood towards the end of the cooking process to prevent overcooking.\n- Vegetarian Jambalaya: Omit the meat and add extra vegetables like okra, bell peppers, and mushrooms. Use vegetable broth instead of chicken broth for a vegetarian-friendly version.\n- Spicier Jambalaya: Increase the amount of cayenne pepper or add chopped jalapeños or hot sauce to give the dish an extra kick.\n\n## Tips and Tricks\n- If you prefer a smokier flavor, use Andouille sausage instead of smoked sausage.\n- For a richer flavor, brown the sausage and chicken thighs in batches before adding the vegetables.\n- Adjust the amount of Cajun seasoning and cayenne pepper according to your spice preference.\n- Be cautious when doing a quick release of the pressure as hot steam will escape from the Instant Pot.\n\n## Nutritional Information\n- Serving Size: 1 cup\n- Calories: 350\n- Fat: 15g\n- Carbohydrates: 32g\n- Protein: 20g\n\n## Storage and Leftovers\n- Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.\n- Reheat the Jambalaya in the microwave or on the stovetop, adding a splash of water or broth to prevent it from drying out.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\nQ: Can I use brown rice instead of white rice?\nA: Yes, you can use brown rice, but keep in mind that it will require a longer cooking time.
