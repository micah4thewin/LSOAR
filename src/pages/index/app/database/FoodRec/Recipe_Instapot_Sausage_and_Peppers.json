This classic Italian-American dish is known for its simplicity and bold flavors. It can be served on its own, over pasta, or in a sandwich.\n\n## Ingredients\n- 4 Italian sausages (sweet or spicy)\n- 2 bell peppers (any color), sliced\n- 1 onion, sliced\n- 3 cloves of garlic, minced\n- 1 can (14 oz) diced tomatoes\n- 1 can (6 oz) tomato paste\n- 1 teaspoon dried oregano\n- 1 teaspoon dried basil\n- 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional, for heat)\n- Salt and pepper, to taste\n- Olive oil, for cooking\n\n## Equipment\n- Instant Pot or pressure cooker\n- Cutting board\n- Knife\n- Wooden spoon or spatula\n\n## Preparation Time\n- 10 minutes\n\n## Cooking Time\n- 25 minutes (including pressure build-up and release time)\n\n## Steps\n1. Set the Instant Pot to sauté mode and add a drizzle of olive oil.\n2. Once the oil is hot, add the sausages and cook until browned on all sides. Remove the sausages from the Instant Pot and set aside.\n3. In the same Instant Pot, add the sliced bell peppers, onion, and minced garlic. Sauté for a few minutes until the vegetables start to soften.\n4. Add the diced tomatoes, tomato paste, dried oregano, dried basil, red pepper flakes (if using), salt, and pepper to the Instant Pot. Stir well to combine.\n5. Return the browned sausages to the Instant Pot, nestling them into the sauce and vegetables.\n6. Close the Instant Pot lid and set the valve to the sealing position.\n7. Select the \"Pressure Cook\" or \"Manual\" setting and set the cooking time to 10 minutes on high pressure.\n8. Once the cooking time is complete, allow for a natural pressure release for 5 minutes, then carefully switch the valve to the venting position to release any remaining pressure.\n9. Open the Instant Pot lid and remove the sausages. Slice them into bite-sized pieces.\n10. Using a wooden spoon or spatula, gently break apart any large chunks of bell peppers or onions.\n11. Serve the sausage and peppers over pasta, rice, or in a sandwich. Spoon some of the tomato sauce over the top.\n12. Enjoy!\n\n## Serving Suggestions\n- Serve the Instapot Sausage and Peppers over cooked pasta, such as penne or spaghetti, for a hearty meal.\n- Alternatively, you can serve it over steamed rice or with crusty bread for a filling and satisfying dinner.\n- Top with grated Parmesan cheese and fresh basil for an extra burst of flavor.\n\n## Variations\n- For a spicier version, use hot Italian sausages or add extra red pepper flakes.\n- Add sliced mushrooms or zucchini to the dish for additional vegetables.\n- Experiment with different types of sausages, such as chicken or turkey sausage, to suit your taste preferences.\n\n## Tips and Tricks\n- Browning the sausages before pressure cooking adds extra flavor and texture to the dish.\n- If you prefer a thicker sauce, you can add a cornstarch slurry (cornstarch mixed with water) to the Instant Pot after cooking and simmer for a few minutes until the sauce thickens.\n- Adjust the seasoning according to your taste.
