This recipe takes a modern twist by using an Instant Pot, making it quick and easy to prepare. The tender chicken pieces are marinated in aromatic spices and then cooked in a creamy and tangy sauce. It is best served with steamed rice or naan bread.\n\n## Ingredients\n- 500g boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into bite-sized pieces\n- 1 cup plain yogurt\n- 2 tablespoons lemon juice\n- 2 tablespoons ginger-garlic paste\n- 2 teaspoons ground cumin\n- 2 teaspoons ground coriander\n- 1 teaspoon ground turmeric\n- 1 teaspoon paprika\n- 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper (adjust to taste)\n- Salt to taste\n- 2 tablespoons oil\n- 1 large onion, finely chopped\n- 4 cloves garlic, minced\n- 1 can (400g) crushed tomatoes\n- 1 cup heavy cream\n- 1 teaspoon garam masala\n- Fresh cilantro, for garnish\n\n## Equipment\n- Instant Pot or pressure cooker\n- Mixing bowls\n- Whisk\n- Cutting board\n- Knife\n- Wooden spoon\n- Serving dish\n\n## Preparation Time\n- Marinating the chicken: 1 hour\n\n## Cooking Time\n- Total cooking time: 30 minutes\n- Active cooking time: 15 minutes\n- Inactive cooking time (Instant Pot coming to pressure and natural release): 15 minutes\n\n## Steps\n1. In a mixing bowl, combine the yogurt, lemon juice, ginger-garlic paste, cumin, coriander, turmeric, paprika, cayenne pepper, and salt. Mix well.\n2. Add the chicken pieces to the marinade and coat them thoroughly. Cover the bowl and let the chicken marinate in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour.\n3. Select the \"Saute\" function on the Instant Pot and heat the oil. Add the chopped onions and sauté until they turn golden brown.\n4. Add the minced garlic and sauté for another minute until fragrant.\n5. Press the \"Cancel\" button to turn off the sauté function. Add the marinated chicken along with any remaining marinade to the Instant Pot.\n6. Pour in the crushed tomatoes and give everything a good stir.\n7. Secure the lid of the Instant Pot and make sure the pressure release valve is set to the \"Sealing\" position.\n8. Select the \"Pressure Cook\" or \"Manual\" setting and set the cooking time to 8 minutes at high pressure.\n9. Once the cooking time is complete, allow the Instant Pot to naturally release pressure for 10 minutes. Then, carefully move the pressure release valve to the \"Venting\" position to release any remaining pressure.\n10. Open the Instant Pot and stir in the heavy cream and garam masala. Simmer the mixture on the \"Saute\" function for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce thickens slightly.\n11. Serve the Chicken Tikka Masala over steamed rice or with naan bread. Garnish with fresh cilantro.\n\n## Serving Suggestions\n- Serve the Chicken Tikka Masala over steamed basmati rice for a classic pairing.\n- Accompany the dish with warm naan bread or roti for a complete Indian meal.\n- For a lighter option, serve the Chicken Tikka Masala with cauliflower rice or quinoa.\n\n## Variations\n- Vegetarian Option: Replace the chicken with paneer (Indian cottage cheese) or tofu for a vegetarian version of the dish.\n- Spicier Version: Increase the amount of cayenne pepper or add chopped green chilies for an extra kick of heat.\n- Creamy Coconut Twist: Substitute half of the heavy cream with coconut milk for a coconut-infused creamy sauce.\n\n## Tips and Tricks\n- For extra tender chicken, marinate it overnight in the refrigerator.\n- Adjust the level of spiciness by increasing or decreasing the amount of cayenne pepper.\n- To save time, you can use store-bought ginger-garlic paste instead of making your own.\n- If the sauce is too thick, add a splash of water or chicken broth to thin it out.\n\n## Nutritional Information\n- The nutritional information provided is approximate and may vary depending on the specific ingredients used.\n- Serving Size: 1 serving\n- Calories: 400\n- Fat: 25g\n- Carbohydrates: 12g\n- Protein: 35g\n\n## Storage and Leftovers\n- Store any leftover Chicken Tikka Masala in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.\n- Reheat the leftovers in the microwave or on the stovetop, adding a splash of water or cream to prevent the sauce from drying out.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n1.
