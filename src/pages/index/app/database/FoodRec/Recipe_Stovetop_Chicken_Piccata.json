This stovetop version of Chicken Piccata is quick and easy to make, perfect for a delicious weeknight dinner. The combination of citrusy flavors and savory chicken makes this dish a crowd-pleaser.\n\n## Ingredients\n- 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts\n- Salt and pepper, to taste\n- 1/2 cup all-purpose flour\n- 2 tablespoons olive oil\n- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided\n- 1/2 cup chicken broth\n- 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice\n- 1/4 cup brined capers, drained\n- 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley\n\n## Equipment\n- Large skillet\n- Tongs\n- Meat mallet or rolling pin (optional)\n\n## Preparation Time\n- 10 minutes\n\n## Cooking Time\n- 20 minutes\n\n## Steps\n1. Start by preparing the chicken breasts. If they are thick, you can use a meat mallet or rolling pin to pound them to an even thickness of about 1/2 inch. Season both sides of the chicken breasts with salt and pepper.\n2. Place the flour in a shallow dish and dredge each chicken breast in the flour, shaking off any excess.\n3. Heat the olive oil and 2 tablespoons of butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once the butter has melted and the skillet is hot, add the chicken breasts.\n4. Cook the chicken for about 4-5 minutes per side, or until golden brown and cooked through. Use tongs to flip the chicken halfway through cooking.\n5. Remove the cooked chicken breasts from the skillet and set them aside on a plate.\n6. In the same skillet, add the chicken broth, lemon juice, and capers. Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook for 2-3 minutes, scraping any browned bits from the bottom of the skillet.\n7. Stir in the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter until melted and incorporated into the sauce. This will help thicken and enrich the sauce.\n8. Return the chicken breasts to the skillet and spoon the sauce over them. Cook for an additional 1-2 minutes to heat the chicken through and allow the flavors to meld.\n9. Garnish with chopped parsley before serving.\n\n## Serving Suggestions\n- Serve the Stovetop Chicken Piccata with a side of pasta or mashed potatoes to soak up the delicious sauce.\n- Pair it with a crisp green salad or steamed vegetables for a well-rounded meal.\n\n## Variations\n- For a lighter version, you can use boneless, skinless chicken thighs instead of chicken breasts.\n- Add a splash of white wine to the sauce for extra depth of flavor.\n- For a creamy twist, stir in a tablespoon of heavy cream or sour cream at the end.\n\n## Tips and Tricks\n- To prevent the chicken from sticking to the skillet, make sure the skillet is hot and the oil is well-heated before adding the chicken.\n- If the chicken breasts are large, you can cut them in half horizontally to create thinner cutlets that cook faster and more evenly.\n- Don't overcrowd the skillet when cooking the chicken. Cook them in batches if necessary to ensure they brown properly.\n\n## Nutritional Information\n- The nutritional information for Stovetop Chicken Piccata may vary depending on the specific ingredients and portion sizes used.
