Translated as \"spaghetti with garlic and oil,\" this dish originated in the region of Abruzzo in Italy. It has gained popularity worldwide due to its quick preparation time and delicious taste. The key to a great Aglio e Olio is using high-quality ingredients and mastering the technique of infusing the oil with garlic flavor.\n\n## Ingredients\n- 8 ounces (225g) spaghetti\n- 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil\n- 4 cloves garlic, thinly sliced\n- 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes (adjust to your spice preference)\n- 1/4 cup fresh parsley, chopped\n- Salt, to taste\n- Grated Parmesan cheese, for serving (optional)\n\n## Equipment\n- Large pot\n- Colander\n- Large skillet or frying pan\n- Wooden spoon or spatula\n- Tongs\n\n## Preparation Time\n- 5 minutes\n\n## Cooking Time\n- 10 minutes\n\n## Steps\n1. Fill a large pot with water and bring it to a boil over high heat. Add a generous amount of salt to the boiling water.\n2.

Cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring frequently, until the garlic turns golden brown and becomes fragrant. Be careful not to burn the garlic.\n5. Once the spaghetti is cooked, carefully transfer it to the skillet using tongs. Reserve some of the pasta cooking water.\n6. Toss the spaghetti in the garlic-infused oil until well coated. If the pasta seems dry, add a splash of the reserved pasta cooking water to moisten it.\n7. Remove the skillet from the heat and sprinkle the chopped parsley over the spaghetti.

Serve the Stovetop Spaghetti Aglio e Olio immediately, garnished with grated Parmesan cheese if desired.\n\n## Serving Suggestions\n- Stovetop Spaghetti Aglio e Olio is delicious on its own but can be served with a variety of accompaniments.
