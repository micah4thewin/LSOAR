Turn on the Instapot and select the saut√© function. Once hot, add the red curry paste and cook for 1-2 minutes until fragrant.\n2. Add the chicken (or tofu) to the Instapot and cook until browned on all sides, about 5 minutes.\n3. Pour in the coconut milk and stir well to combine with the curry paste.\n4.

Select the manual or pressure cook function and set the timer for 5 minutes.\n7. Once the cooking time is complete, allow the pressure to naturally release for 5 minutes, then carefully release any remaining pressure using the quick release valve.\n8. Open the lid and stir in the fish sauce (or soy sauce), brown sugar, and lime juice.\n9. Serve the Thai Red Curry over cooked rice and garnish with fresh cilantro.\n\n## Serving Suggestions\n- Thai Red Curry is delicious on its own, but you can also serve it with steamed jasmine rice or noodles for a heartier meal.\n- Garnish with lime wedges and sliced red chili for an extra kick of flavor.\n- Serve with a side of Thai cucumber salad or fresh spring rolls for a complete Thai-inspired meal.\n\n## Variations\n- For a vegetarian version, substitute the chicken with tofu or your favorite vegetables like broccoli, carrots, or baby corn.\n- Adjust the spiciness by adding more or less red curry paste according to your taste preferences.\n- Add a can of drained pineapple chunks for a sweet and tangy twist to the curry.\n\n## Tips and Tricks\n- Be cautious when handling red curry paste as it can stain clothing and surfaces.\n- If you prefer a thicker curry, you can mix 1 tablespoon of cornstarch with 2 tablespoons of water and add it to the curry after cooking. Allow it to simmer for a few minutes until thickened.\n- Adjust the seasoning according to your taste by adding more fish sauce (or soy sauce), sugar, or lime juice.\n\n## Nutritional Information\n- The nutritional information for this recipe may vary depending on the specific ingredients used and the serving size.
