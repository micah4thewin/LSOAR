It is made by sautéing rice with onions, garlic, and tomatoes, then simmering it in broth until fluffy and fragrant. This recipe provides a simple and delicious way to enjoy this classic rice dish at home.\n\n## Ingredients\n- 1 cup long-grain white rice\n- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil\n- 1/2 cup diced onion\n- 2 cloves garlic, minced\n- 1/2 cup diced tomatoes (fresh or canned)\n- 1 3/4 cups vegetable or chicken broth\n- 1 teaspoon cumin\n- 1 teaspoon chili powder\n- Salt and pepper to taste\n- Optional garnish: chopped fresh cilantro\n\n## Equipment\n- Large skillet or frying pan with a tight-fitting lid\n- Wooden spoon or spatula\n- Measuring cups and spoons\n\n## Preparation Time\n- 10 minutes\n\n## Cooking Time\n- 20 minutes\n\n## Steps\n1. Rinse the rice under cold water until the water runs clear. This helps remove excess starch and prevents the rice from becoming sticky.\n2. Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet or frying pan over medium heat.\n3. Add the diced onion and minced garlic to the skillet and sauté until the onion becomes translucent and fragrant, about 2-3 minutes.\n4. Stir in the diced tomatoes, cumin, and chili powder. Cook for another 2 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.\n5. Add the rinsed rice to the skillet and stir to coat the grains with the onion, garlic, and tomato mixture.\n6. Pour in the vegetable or chicken broth and season with salt and pepper to taste. Stir well to combine.\n7. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. Cover the skillet with a tight-fitting lid and simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until the rice is tender and has absorbed all the liquid.\n8. Remove the skillet from heat and let it sit, covered, for 5 minutes to allow the rice to steam and become fluffy.\n9. Fluff the rice with a fork and garnish with chopped fresh cilantro, if desired.\n10. Serve hot as a side dish or as a base for other Mexican-inspired dishes.\n\n## Serving Suggestions\n- Stovetop Mexican Rice pairs well with a variety of dishes, such as:\n  - Grilled chicken or beef fajitas\n  - Enchiladas\n  - Tacos\n  - Burritos\n  - Quesadillas\n  - Mexican-style grilled vegetables\n\n## Variations\n- For a spicier version, add a diced jalapeño or a pinch of cayenne pepper.\n- Add a handful of frozen peas or corn to the rice for extra color and flavor.\n- Substitute the vegetable or chicken broth with tomato juice for a more tomato-forward taste.\n- Stir in cooked black beans or diced bell peppers for added texture and nutrition.\n\n## Tips and Tricks\n- Use a skillet or frying pan with a tight-fitting lid to ensure the rice cooks evenly and absorbs the liquid properly.\n- Avoid lifting the lid while the rice is simmering to prevent steam from escaping and ensure even cooking.\n- Feel free to adjust the seasonings according to your taste preferences.
