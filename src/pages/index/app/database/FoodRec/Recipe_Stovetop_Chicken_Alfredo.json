Add the chicken breasts to the skillet and cook for 6-8 minutes per side, or until cooked through and no longer pink in the center.\n4. While the chicken is cooking, bring a pot of salted water to a boil and cook the fettuccine pasta according to package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.\n5. Remove the cooked chicken from the skillet and let it rest for a few minutes. Then, slice it into thin strips.\n6. In the same skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and sauté for 1-2 minutes until fragrant.\n7. Pour in the heavy cream and bring it to a simmer. Cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally.\n8. Gradually whisk in the grated Parmesan cheese until it melts and the sauce becomes smooth.\n9. Stir in the nutmeg and season with salt and pepper to taste.\n10. Add the cooked fettuccine pasta to the skillet with the Alfredo sauce and toss until the pasta is well coated.\n11. Finally, add the sliced chicken to the skillet and gently toss to combine.\n12. Serve the Stovetop Chicken Alfredo hot, garnished with fresh parsley.\n\n## Serving Suggestions\n- Serve the Stovetop Chicken Alfredo as a main course with a side of garlic bread or a fresh green salad.\n- Pair it with a glass of white wine, such as Chardonnay or Pinot Grigio, to complement the creamy flavors.\n\n## Variations\n- For a lighter version, you can use half-and-half or whole milk instead of heavy cream.\n- Add some vegetables like broccoli, mushrooms, or peas to the dish for extra flavor and nutrition.\n- Substitute the fettuccine pasta with your favorite pasta shape, such as penne or linguine.\n\n## Tips and Tricks\n- Make sure to cook the chicken thoroughly to an internal temperature of 165°F (74°C) for food safety.\n- To prevent the Alfredo sauce from curdling, stir it constantly while adding the Parmesan cheese and avoid overheating.\n- For a smoother sauce, grate the Parmesan cheese yourself instead of using pre-grated cheese.\n\n## Nutritional Information\n- The nutritional values may vary depending on the specific ingredients used and the portion sizes.
