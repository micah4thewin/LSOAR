  "article": "## Puppeteer: Working with Websockets\n\n### Introduction\nPuppeteer is a Node.js library that provides a high-level API for controlling headless Chrome or Chromium browsers. It allows you to automate tasks such as generating screenshots, PDFs, and crawling web pages. In addition to these features, Puppeteer also provides support for working with websockets.\n\nThis documentation will guide you through the process of using Puppeteer to interact with websockets in your web applications.\n\n### Objective and Scope\nThe objective of this guide is to provide step-by-step instructions on how to work with websockets using Puppeteer. It covers the necessary requirements and pre-requisites, provides code snippets and commands, troubleshoots common issues, and offers best practices and recommendations.\n\n### Requirements and Pre-requisites\nTo follow along with this guide, you will need the following:\n\n- Node.js installed on your machine\n- Basic knowledge of JavaScript and websockets\n\n### Step-by-Step Instructions\n1. Install Puppeteer by running the following command in your terminal:\n   ```\n   npm install puppeteer\n   ```\n\n2. Import the Puppeteer library into your JavaScript file:\n   ```javascript\n   const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');\n   ```\n\n3. Launch a headless browser instance using Puppeteer:\n   ```javascript\n   const browser = await puppeteer.launch();\n   const page = await browser.newPage();\n   ```\n\n4. Navigate to a webpage that uses websockets:\n   ```javascript\n   await page.goto('https://example.com');\n   ```\n\n5. Enable the network interception feature in Puppeteer:\n   ```javascript\n   await page.setRequestInterception(true);\n\n   page.on('request', (request) => {\n     if (request.url().startsWith('wss://')) {\n       // Handle websocket requests here\n     } else {\n       request.continue();\n     }\n   });\n   ```\n\n6. Handle websocket requests:\n   ```javascript\n   page.on('websocket', (websocket) => {\n     // Perform actions on the websocket connection\n   });\n   ```\n\n7. Close the browser instance when you are done:\n   ```javascript\n   await browser.close();\n   ```\n\n### Code Snippets and Commands\n- Install Puppeteer:\n  ```\n  npm install puppeteer\n  ```\n\n- Import Puppeteer into your JavaScript file:\n  ```javascript\n  const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');\n  ```\n\n- Launch a headless browser instance:\n  ```javascript\n  const browser = await puppeteer.launch();\n  const page = await browser.newPage();\n  ```\n\n- Navigate to a webpage:\n  ```javascript\n  await page.goto('https://example.com');\n  ```\n\n- Enable network interception:\n  ```javascript\n  await page.setRequestInterception(true);\n  ```\n\n- Handle websocket requests:\n  ```javascript\n  page.on('websocket', (websocket) => {\n    // Perform actions on the websocket connection\n  });\n  ```\n\n- Close the browser instance:\n  ```javascript\n  await browser.close();\n  ```\n\n### Troubleshooting and Common Issues\n- If you are unable to install Puppeteer, make sure you have Node.js installed and try running the installation command with administrative privileges.\n- If you are unable to intercept websocket requests, ensure that the page you are navigating to is using websockets and that the websocket URL starts with `wss://`.\n\n### Best Practices and Recommendations\n- Use Puppeteer's network interception feature to handle websocket requests.\n- Test your code thoroughly to ensure that it works as expected with different web applications that use websockets.\n- Follow best practices for handling websockets to ensure optimal performance and security.\n\n### Summary and Conclusion\nPuppeteer provides a convenient and powerful API for working with websockets in web applications. By following the step-by-step instructions in this guide, you can easily integrate Puppeteer into your workflow and automate tasks involving websockets. Remember to follow best practices and test your code thoroughly for optimal results."
