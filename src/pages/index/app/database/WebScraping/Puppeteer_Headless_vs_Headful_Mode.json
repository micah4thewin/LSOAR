  "article": "## Puppeteer Headless vs Headful Mode\n\n### Introduction\n\nPuppeteer is a Node.js library that provides a high-level API for controlling headless Chrome or Chromium browsers. It allows you to automate tasks such as generating screenshots, PDFs, crawling websites, and interacting with web pages programmatically.\n\nWhen using Puppeteer, you have the option to run the browser in headless mode or headful mode. In this article, we will explore the differences between these two modes and when to use each.\n\n### Objective and Scope\n\nThe objective of this documentation is to explain the differences between Puppeteer's headless and headful modes and provide guidance on when to use each mode. It will cover the requirements, step-by-step instructions, and best practices for using Puppeteer in both modes.\n\n### Requirements and Pre-requisites\n\nTo follow along with this documentation, you will need:\n\n- Node.js installed on your machine\n- Basic knowledge of JavaScript\n\n### Step-by-Step Instructions\n\n1. Install Puppeteer by running the following command in your terminal:\n\n```shell\nnpm install puppeteer\n```\n\n2. Require Puppeteer in your JavaScript file:\n\n```javascript\nconst puppeteer = require('puppeteer');\n```\n\n3. Launch a headless browser instance by using the `puppeteer.launch()` method with the `headless` option set to `true`:\n\n```javascript\nconst browser = await puppeteer.launch({ headless: true });\n```\n\n4. Launch a headful browser instance by setting the `headless` option to `false`:\n\n```javascript\nconst browser = await puppeteer.launch({ headless: false });\n```\n\n5. Perform any desired actions using the Puppeteer API, such as navigating to a URL and taking a screenshot:\n\n```javascript\nconst page = await browser.newPage();\nawait page.goto('https://example.com');\nawait page.screenshot({ path: 'screenshot.png' });\n```\n\n6. Close the browser instance when finished:\n\n```javascript\nawait browser.close();\n```\n\n### Code Snippets and Commands\n\n- Install Puppeteer:\n\n```shell\nnpm install puppeteer\n```\n\n- Launch a headless browser instance:\n\n```javascript\nconst browser = await puppeteer.launch({ headless: true });\n```\n\n- Launch a headful browser instance:\n\n```javascript\nconst browser = await puppeteer.launch({ headless: false });\n```\n\n- Take a screenshot:\n\n```javascript\nawait page.screenshot({ path: 'screenshot.png' });\n```\n\n### Troubleshooting and Common Issues\n\n- If you encounter any errors while installing or using Puppeteer, make sure you have the latest version of Node.js installed and try again.\n- If you are running Puppeteer in headless mode and need to debug an issue, you can switch to headful mode temporarily by setting the `headless` option to `false` when launching the browser.\n\n### Best Practices and Recommendations\n\n- Use headless mode when running Puppeteer in production or on a server, as it provides better performance and consumes fewer resources.\n- Use headful mode when developing or debugging Puppeteer scripts, as it allows you to see the browser window and interact with the page in real-time.\n\n### Summary and Conclusion\n\nPuppeteer offers the flexibility to run the browser in either headless or headful mode. Headless mode is recommended for production use, while headful mode is useful for development and debugging purposes. By following the step-by-step instructions and best practices outlined in this documentation, you can effectively utilize Puppeteer in either mode to automate browser tasks and interact with web pages programmatically."
