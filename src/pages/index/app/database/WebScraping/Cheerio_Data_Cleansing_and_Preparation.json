It allows you to traverse the HTML structure, manipulate elements, and extract data easily. This documentation will guide you through the process of using Cheerio for data cleansing and preparation.\n\n### Objective and Scope\nThe objective of this documentation is to provide a step-by-step guide on using Cheerio for data cleansing and preparation. The scope of this documentation covers the basic usage of Cheerio and its core functionalities.\n\n### Requirements and Pre-requisites\nBefore proceeding, make sure you have the following requirements and pre-requisites in place:\n- Node.js installed on your machine\n- Basic knowledge of JavaScript and HTML\n\n### Step-by-Step Instructions\n1. Install Cheerio by running the following command in your terminal:\n```\nnpm install cheerio\n```\n2. Create a new JavaScript file and require Cheerio:\n```javascript\nconst cheerio = require('cheerio');\n```\n3. Load the HTML content into Cheerio:\n```javascript\nconst html = '<div><h1>Hello, World!</h1></div>';\nconst $ = cheerio.load(html);\n```\n4. Use Cheerio's selectors to manipulate and extract data from the HTML structure. For example, to extract the text inside the `<h1>` tag, you can use the following code:\n```javascript\nconst text = $('h1').text();\nconsole.log(text); // Output: Hello, World!\n```\n5. Cheerio also provides methods to modify the HTML structure. For example, to add a class to an element, you can use the `addClass` method:\n```javascript\n$('h1').addClass('title');\n```\n6. Once you have performed the necessary data cleansing and preparation, you can convert the modified HTML back to a string using the `.html()` method:\n```javascript\nconst modifiedHtml = $.html();\n```\n\n### Code Snippets and Commands\n\n- Install Cheerio:\n```\nnpm install cheerio\n```\n\n- Require Cheerio in your JavaScript file:\n```javascript\nconst cheerio = require('cheerio');\n```\n\n- Load HTML content into Cheerio:\n```javascript\nconst $ = cheerio.load(html);\n```\n\n- Extract text from an element:\n```javascript\nconst text = $('h1').text();\n```\n\n- Add a class to an element:\n```javascript\n$('h1').addClass('title');\n```\n\n- Convert modified HTML back to a string:\n```javascript\nconst modifiedHtml = $.html();\n```\n\n### Troubleshooting and Common Issues\n- If you encounter an error saying \"cheerio is not defined\", make sure you have required Cheerio properly in your JavaScript file.\n\n### Best Practices and Recommendations\n- Use Cheerio's selectors efficiently to target specific elements for data extraction or manipulation.\n- Take advantage of Cheerio's methods for modifying the HTML structure, such as adding classes or attributes.\n\n### Summary and Conclusion\nCheerio is a powerful tool for data cleansing and preparation in Node.js. By following the step-by-step instructions in this documentation, you should now have a good understanding of how to use Cheerio for these purposes. Remember to refer to the code snippets and commands provided for quick reference. Happy data cleansing!"
