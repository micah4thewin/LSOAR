It allows you to automate tasks such as generating screenshots, PDFs, and crawling web pages.\n\nOne of the key features of Puppeteer is the ability to create custom extensions. Extensions are small programs that modify the behavior of the browser. They can be used to add functionality, enhance security, or customize the user experience.\n\nThis documentation will guide you through the process of creating custom extensions using Puppeteer.\n\n### Objective and Scope\nThe objective of this documentation is to provide step-by-step instructions on creating custom extensions using Puppeteer. The scope of this documentation covers the basic concepts and techniques required to create and use custom extensions.\n\n### Requirements and Pre-requisites\nTo create custom extensions using Puppeteer, you will need the following:\n\n- Node.js and npm installed on your system\n- Basic understanding of JavaScript and Node.js\n- Familiarity with Puppeteer and its API\n\n### Step-by-Step Instructions\n1. Install Puppeteer by running the following command:\n   ```\n   npm install puppeteer\n   ```\n\n2. Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it:\n   ```\n   mkdir my-extension\n   cd my-extension\n   ```\n\n3. Initialize a new Node.js project:\n   ```\n   npm init\n   ```\n\n4. Install the Puppeteer package as a dependency:\n   ```\n   npm install puppeteer --save\n   ```\n\n5. Create a new JavaScript file, e.g., `extension.js`, and add the following code:\n   ```javascript\n   const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');\n\n   (async () => {\n     const browser = await puppeteer.launch();\n     const page = await browser.newPage();\n     // Your extension code here\n     await browser.close();\n   })();\n   ```\n\n6. Add your custom extension code within the `page.evaluateOnNewDocument` function. For example:\n   ```javascript\n   await page.evaluateOnNewDocument(() => {\n     // Your custom extension code here\n   });\n   ```\n\n7. Run your extension by executing the JavaScript file:\n   ```\n   node extension.js\n   ```\n\n### Code Snippets and Commands\n- Install Puppeteer:\n  ```\n  npm install puppeteer\n  ```\n\n- Create a new directory and navigate to it:\n  ```\n  mkdir my-extension\n  cd my-extension\n  ```\n\n- Initialize a new Node.js project:\n  ```\n  npm init\n  ```\n\n- Install Puppeteer as a dependency:\n  ```\n  npm install puppeteer --save\n  ```\n\n- Launch Puppeteer and create a new page:\n  ```javascript\n  const browser = await puppeteer.launch();\n  const page = await browser.newPage();\n  ```\n\n- Add custom extension code:\n  ```javascript\n  await page.evaluateOnNewDocument(() => {\n    // Your custom extension code here\n  });\n  ```\n\n- Close the browser:\n  ```\n  await browser.close();\n  ```\n\n- Run the extension:\n  ```\n  node extension.js\n  ```\n\n### Troubleshooting and Common Issues\n- If you encounter any issues while installing or running Puppeteer, make sure you have the latest version of Node.js installed.\n- Check the Puppeteer documentation and GitHub repository for known issues and solutions.\n- Ensure that your custom extension code is valid and does not contain any syntax errors.\n\n### Best Practices and Recommendations\n- Keep your custom extension code modular and reusable.\n- Test your extension thoroughly to ensure it works as expected.\n- Follow best practices for secure coding when writing custom extensions.\n- Regularly update Puppeteer and your custom extension to benefit from new features and bug fixes.\n\n### Summary and Conclusion\nCreating custom extensions using Puppeteer allows you to modify the behavior of the browser and add new functionality. This documentation provided step-by-step instructions on how to create custom extensions using Puppeteer. By following the instructions and best practices, you can enhance your Puppeteer automation workflows and achieve your desired results."
