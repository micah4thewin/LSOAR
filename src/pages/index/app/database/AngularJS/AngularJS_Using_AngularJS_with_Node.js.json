It provides a structured way to develop single-page applications (SPAs) by extending HTML with additional attributes and features. Node.js, on the other hand, is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript on the server-side. In this documentation, we will explore how to use AngularJS with Node.js to build powerful and scalable web applications.\n\n### Objective and Scope\nThe objective of this documentation is to guide developers in using AngularJS with Node.js to create web applications. It covers the necessary requirements, step-by-step instructions, code snippets, troubleshooting tips, and best practices to ensure a smooth development process.\n\n### Requirements and Pre-requisites\nBefore getting started, make sure you have the following requirements and pre-requisites in place:\n\n- Node.js installed on your system\n- Basic knowledge of JavaScript and HTML\n- Familiarity with AngularJS concepts and syntax\n\n### Step-by-Step Instructions\nFollow these step-by-step instructions to use AngularJS with Node.js:\n\n1. Create a new directory for your project.\n2. Open the command line or terminal and navigate to the project directory.\n3. Initialize a new Node.js project by running the following command:\n   ```\n   npm init\n   ```\n4. Follow the prompts and provide the necessary information to set up the project.\n5. Install AngularJS by running the following command:\n   ```\n   npm install angular\n   ```\n6. Create an HTML file in the project directory and add the necessary AngularJS script tag:\n   ```html\n   <script src=\"node_modules/angular/angular.js\"></script>\n   ```\n7. Start building your AngularJS application by adding AngularJS code to the HTML file.\n8. Use Node.js to serve the HTML file. You can use a simple HTTP server like `http-server` or `express` to serve the file.\n9. Start the Node.js server by running the following command:\n   ```\n   node server.js\n   ```\n10. Open your web browser and navigate to the server URL to see your AngularJS application in action.\n\n### Code Snippets and Commands\nHere are some relevant code snippets and commands for using AngularJS with Node.js:\n\n- Install AngularJS:\n  ```\n  npm install angular\n  ```\n\n- AngularJS script tag in HTML file:\n  ```html\n  <script src=\"node_modules/angular/angular.js\"></script>\n  ```\n\n- Start Node.js server:\n  ```\n  node server.js\n  ```\n\n### Troubleshooting and Common Issues\nIf you encounter any issues while using AngularJS with Node.js, refer to the following troubleshooting tips:\n\n- Make sure you have installed Node.js and AngularJS correctly.\n- Check for any errors in the browser console or terminal.\n- Verify that the necessary dependencies are installed and up to date.\n- Double-check the file paths and ensure they are correct.\n\n### Best Practices and Recommendations\nTo ensure optimal performance and security when using AngularJS with Node.js, consider the following best practices and recommendations:\n\n- Use AngularJS modules to organize your code and promote reusability.\n- Implement server-side validation to prevent malicious input.\n- Minify and bundle your JavaScript files for faster loading times.\n- Use a version control system like Git to track changes and collaborate with other developers.\n- Regularly update your dependencies to take advantage of the latest features and security patches.\n\n### Summary and Conclusion\nIn conclusion, using AngularJS with Node.js allows developers to build robust web applications with ease. This documentation provided an overview of the topic, outlined the objectives and scope, listed the requirements and pre-requisites, provided step-by-step instructions, shared code snippets and commands, offered troubleshooting tips, and recommended best practices. By following these guidelines, you can leverage the power of AngularJS and Node.js to create modern and efficient web applications."
