  "article": "## AngularJS: Enhancing Performance with $cacheFactory\n\n### Introduction\nAngularJS is a popular JavaScript framework that allows developers to build dynamic web applications. One of the key features of AngularJS is its ability to cache data for improved performance. In this article, we will explore how to enhance the performance of an AngularJS application using the $cacheFactory service.\n\n### Objective and Scope\nThe objective of this documentation is to provide a step-by-step guide on how to use the $cacheFactory service in AngularJS to cache data and improve application performance. The scope of this documentation is limited to the usage of $cacheFactory and does not cover other performance optimization techniques in AngularJS.\n\n### Requirements and Pre-requisites\nTo follow along with this guide, you will need the following:\n\n- Basic knowledge of AngularJS\n- An AngularJS application set up and running\n- A text editor or an IDE\n\n### Step-by-Step Instructions\n1. **Inject $cacheFactory**: In your AngularJS application, inject the $cacheFactory service into your controller or service where you want to use caching.\n\n   ```javascript\n   angular.module('myApp').controller('myController', function($cacheFactory) {\n     // Your code here\n   });\n   ```\n\n2. **Create a Cache**: Use the $cacheFactory service to create a cache object.\n\n   ```javascript\n   var myCache = $cacheFactory('myCache');\n   ```\n\n3. **Add Data to Cache**: Add data to the cache using the `put` method.\n\n   ```javascript\n   myCache.put('key', 'value');\n   ```\n\n4. **Retrieve Data from Cache**: Retrieve data from the cache using the `get` method.\n\n   ```javascript\n   var data = myCache.get('key');\n   ```\n\n5. **Remove Data from Cache**: Remove data from the cache using the `remove` method.\n\n   ```javascript\n   myCache.remove('key');\n   ```\n\n6. **Clear Cache**: Clear the entire cache using the `removeAll` method.\n\n   ```javascript\n   myCache.removeAll();\n   ```\n\n7. **Check Cache Info**: Check the cache information using the `info` method.\n\n   ```javascript\n   var cacheInfo = myCache.info();\n   ```\n\n8. **Set Cache Capacity**: Set the maximum number of entries the cache can hold using the `setCapacity` method.\n\n   ```javascript\n   myCache.setCapacity(100);\n   ```\n\n9. **Destroy Cache**: Destroy the cache using the `destroy` method.\n\n   ```javascript\n   myCache.destroy();\n   ```\n\n### Code Snippets and Commands\nHere are some code snippets and commands related to using $cacheFactory in AngularJS:\n\n- Injecting $cacheFactory:\n\n  ```javascript\n  angular.module('myApp').controller('myController', function($cacheFactory) {\n    // Your code here\n  });\n  ```\n\n- Creating a cache:\n\n  ```javascript\n  var myCache = $cacheFactory('myCache');\n  ```\n\n- Adding data to cache:\n\n  ```javascript\n  myCache.put('key', 'value');\n  ```\n\n- Retrieving data from cache:\n\n  ```javascript\n  var data = myCache.get('key');\n  ```\n\n- Removing data from cache:\n\n  ```javascript\n  myCache.remove('key');\n  ```\n\n- Clearing cache:\n\n  ```javascript\n  myCache.removeAll();\n  ```\n\n- Checking cache info:\n\n  ```javascript\n  var cacheInfo = myCache.info();\n  ```\n\n- Setting cache capacity:\n\n  ```javascript\n  myCache.setCapacity(100);\n  ```\n\n- Destroying cache:\n\n  ```javascript\n  myCache.destroy();\n  ```\n\n### Troubleshooting and Common Issues\n- **Cache not working**: Make sure you have injected the $cacheFactory service and created a cache object correctly. Check if you are using the correct cache key when adding or retrieving data.\n\n- **Cache size limitation**: If you are experiencing issues with cache size, consider setting a maximum capacity using the `setCapacity` method.\n\n### Best Practices and Recommendations\n- Use caching for frequently accessed data that doesn't change often. Caching can greatly improve performance by reducing server requests.\n\n- Be mindful of cache size. If your cache grows too large, it can impact the performance of your application. Set a reasonable maximum capacity to prevent excessive memory usage.\n\n### Summary and Conclusion\nIn this article, we explored how to enhance the performance of an AngularJS application using the $cacheFactory service. We learned how to create a cache, add and retrieve data from the cache, remove data, clear the entire cache, check cache information, set cache capacity, and destroy the cache. By utilizing caching, you can significantly improve the performance of your AngularJS application."
