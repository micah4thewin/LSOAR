  "article": "## AngularJS Framework Overview\n\n### Introduction\nAngularJS is a popular JavaScript framework developed by Google. It is used for building dynamic web applications and provides a powerful set of features to simplify the development process. This documentation will provide an overview of AngularJS and its key features.\n\n### Objective and Scope\nThe objective of this documentation is to provide a comprehensive understanding of AngularJS and its capabilities. It will cover the basic concepts, requirements, and best practices for using AngularJS. The scope of this documentation will be limited to the core features of AngularJS and will not cover advanced topics or specific use cases.\n\n### Requirements and Pre-requisites\nBefore getting started with AngularJS, there are a few requirements and pre-requisites that need to be met:\n\n- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.\n- A code editor such as Visual Studio Code or Sublime Text.\n- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine.\n\n### Step-by-Step Instructions\nTo start using AngularJS, follow these step-by-step instructions:\n\n1. Install AngularJS using npm:\n   ```\n   npm install angular\n   ```\n\n2. Create a new HTML file and include the AngularJS script:\n   ```html\n   <script src=\"path/to/angular.js\"></script>\n   ```\n\n3. Add the `ng-app` directive to the root element of your HTML file:\n   ```html\n   <html ng-app=\"myApp\">\n   ```\n\n4. Create a new module in JavaScript:\n   ```javascript\n   var app = angular.module('myApp', []);\n   ```\n\n5. Add a controller to the module:\n   ```javascript\n   app.controller('myController', function($scope) {\n     // Controller logic goes here\n   });\n   ```\n\n6. Add the controller to your HTML file using the `ng-controller` directive:\n   ```html\n   <div ng-controller=\"myController\">\n     <!-- HTML content goes here -->\n   </div>\n   ```\n\n7. Use AngularJS directives and expressions to bind data and create dynamic content:\n   ```html\n   <h1>{{ title }}</h1>\n   <p ng-show=\"showMessage\">{{ message }}</p>\n   ```\n\n8. Test your application by opening the HTML file in a web browser.\n\n### Code Snippets and Commands\nHere are some useful code snippets and commands for working with AngularJS:\n\n- AngularJS script tag:\n  ```html\n  <script src=\"path/to/angular.js\"></script>\n  ```\n\n- Creating a module:\n  ```javascript\n  var app = angular.module('myApp', []);\n  ```\n\n- Creating a controller:\n  ```javascript\n  app.controller('myController', function($scope) {\n    // Controller logic goes here\n  });\n  ```\n\n- Using ng-app directive:\n  ```html\n  <html ng-app=\"myApp\">\n  ```\n\n- Using ng-controller directive:\n  ```html\n  <div ng-controller=\"myController\">\n    <!-- HTML content goes here -->\n  </div>\n  ```\n\n### Troubleshooting and Common Issues\nIf you encounter any issues while working with AngularJS, here are some common problems and their solutions:\n\n- **Problem**: AngularJS is not working.\n  **Solution**: Make sure you have included the AngularJS script tag in your HTML file and that the path to the script is correct.\n\n- **Problem**: AngularJS directives are not working.\n  **Solution**: Check if you have added the `ng-app` directive to the root element of your HTML file and the `ng-controller` directive to the appropriate elements.\n\n- **Problem**: AngularJS expressions are not displaying the expected values.\n  **Solution**: Verify that the expressions are correctly written and that the corresponding variables are defined in the controller.\n\n### Best Practices and Recommendations\nTo ensure optimal performance and maintainable code, consider following these best practices and recommendations when working with AngularJS:\n\n- Use the AngularJS documentation as a reference for understanding the available directives, filters, and services.\n- Keep your controllers and templates separate for better organization and readability.\n- Minimize the use of `$scope` and prefer using the `controller as` syntax for better code structure.\n- Use AngularJS services for sharing data and functionality between controllers.\n- Optimize your application by avoiding unnecessary watchers and using one-time bindings where applicable.\n\n### Summary and Conclusion\nAngularJS is a powerful framework for building dynamic web applications. It simplifies the development process by providing a set of features like two-way data binding, directives, and dependency injection. By following the step-by-step instructions and best practices outlined in this documentation, you can start building your own AngularJS applications with ease."
