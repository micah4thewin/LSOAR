One of its key features is the ability to make HTTP requests to fetch data from servers. In AngularJS, there are two main services that can be used to make HTTP requests - `$http` and `$resource`. This article will provide a step-by-step guide on how to use these services effectively in your AngularJS application.\n\n### Objective and Scope\nThe objective of this documentation is to provide a comprehensive guide on using the `$http` and `$resource` services in AngularJS. By the end of this article, you should be able to understand how to make HTTP requests, handle responses, and handle errors using these services. This documentation assumes that you have a basic understanding of AngularJS and JavaScript.\n\n### Requirements and Pre-requisites\nTo follow along with the examples in this documentation, you will need the following:\n\n- AngularJS: Make sure you have AngularJS installed in your project. You can include it via a CDN or by downloading it locally.\n- A server with a REST API: In order to make HTTP requests, you will need a server that provides a REST API. You can use a mock server or a real server for this purpose.\n\n### Step-by-Step Instructions\n1. **Using $http**: The `$http` service is the core AngularJS service for making HTTP requests. To use it, you need to inject it into your controller or service. Here's an example of how to use `$http` to make a GET request:\n\n```javascript\n$http.get('/api/users')\n  .then(function(response) {\n    // Handle successful response\n    console.log(response.data);\n  })\n  .catch(function(error) {\n    // Handle error\n    console.error(error);\n  });\n```\n\n2. **Using $resource**: The `$resource` service is a higher-level abstraction of `$http` that makes it easier to work with RESTful APIs. To use it, you need to include the `ngResource` module in your application and inject the `$resource` service into your controller or service. Here's an example of how to use `$resource` to make a GET request:\n\n```javascript\nvar User = $resource('/api/users/:id', { id: '@id' });\n\nUser.get({ id: 1 }, function(response) {\n  // Handle successful response\n  console.log(response);\n}, function(error) {\n  // Handle error\n  console.error(error);\n});\n```\n\n### Code Snippets and Commands\n- `$http` example:\n```javascript\n$http.get('/api/users')\n  .then(function(response) {\n    console.log(response.data);\n  })\n  .catch(function(error) {\n    console.error(error);\n  });\n```\n\n- `$resource` example:\n```javascript\nvar User = $resource('/api/users/:id', { id: '@id' });\n\nUser.get({ id: 1 }, function(response) {\n  console.log(response);\n}, function(error) {\n  console.error(error);\n});\n```\n\n### Troubleshooting and Common Issues\n- CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) issues: If you are making HTTP requests to a different domain than your AngularJS application, you may encounter CORS issues. To resolve this, make sure that the server is configured to allow cross-origin requests from your domain.\n\n- Handling authentication: If your API requires authentication, you will need to include the necessary headers or tokens in your HTTP requests. Consult the documentation of your API for more information on how to handle authentication.\n\n### Best Practices and Recommendations\n- Use `$resource` for RESTful APIs: If you are working with a RESTful API, it is recommended to use the `$resource` service as it provides a higher-level abstraction and makes it easier to work with resources.\n\n- Handle errors gracefully: Always handle errors in your HTTP requests and provide meaningful error messages to the user. This will help in debugging and troubleshooting any issues that may arise.\n\n### Summary and Conclusion\nIn this documentation, we have covered the basics of using the `$http` and `$resource` services in AngularJS for making HTTP requests. We have provided step-by-step instructions, code snippets, and troubleshooting tips to help you get started. By following the best practices and recommendations, you can build robust and efficient web applications using AngularJS."
