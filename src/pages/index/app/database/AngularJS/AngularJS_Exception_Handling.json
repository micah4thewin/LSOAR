  "article": "## AngularJS Exception Handling\n\n### Introduction\nAngularJS is a popular JavaScript framework used for building web applications. Exception handling is an important aspect of any application development process as it helps in identifying and handling errors gracefully. In this article, we will explore how to handle exceptions in AngularJS applications.\n\n### Objective and Scope\nThe objective of this documentation is to provide a step-by-step guide on how to handle exceptions in AngularJS applications. The scope of this documentation includes the necessary requirements and pre-requisites, detailed instructions, code snippets and commands, troubleshooting tips, best practices, and recommendations.\n\n### Requirements and Pre-requisites\nBefore proceeding with exception handling in AngularJS, make sure you have the following requirements and pre-requisites in place:\n\n- Basic knowledge of AngularJS framework\n- AngularJS application set up and running\n- Text editor or IDE for code editing\n\n### Step-by-Step Instructions\nFollow these step-by-step instructions to handle exceptions in your AngularJS application:\n\n1. First, create a custom exception handler by extending the `$exceptionHandler` service. This service is responsible for handling exceptions in AngularJS.\n\n   ```javascript\n   angular.module('myApp').factory('customExceptionHandler', function($log) {\n     return function(exception, cause) {\n       // Custom exception handling logic\n       $log.error(exception, cause);\n     };\n   });\n   ```\n\n2. Next, configure AngularJS to use the custom exception handler by providing it as a dependency to the `$exceptionHandlerProvider`.\n\n   ```javascript\n   angular.module('myApp').config(function($exceptionHandlerProvider) {\n     $exceptionHandlerProvider.$get = function(customExceptionHandler) {\n       return customExceptionHandler;\n     };\n   });\n   ```\n\n3. Now, whenever an exception occurs in your AngularJS application, it will be handled by the custom exception handler. You can modify the `customExceptionHandler` factory to include your own exception handling logic, such as logging the exception or displaying a user-friendly error message.\n\n### Code Snippets and Commands\nHere are some relevant code snippets and commands related to exception handling in AngularJS:\n\n- Code snippet to handle exceptions in AngularJS:\n\n  ```javascript\n  angular.module('myApp').factory('customExceptionHandler', function($log) {\n    return function(exception, cause) {\n      // Custom exception handling logic\n      $log.error(exception, cause);\n    };\n  });\n  ```\n\n- Code snippet to configure AngularJS to use the custom exception handler:\n\n  ```javascript\n  angular.module('myApp').config(function($exceptionHandlerProvider) {\n    $exceptionHandlerProvider.$get = function(customExceptionHandler) {\n      return customExceptionHandler;\n    };\n  });\n  ```\n\n### Troubleshooting and Common Issues\nHere are some common issues you may encounter while handling exceptions in AngularJS and their solutions:\n\n1. **Exceptions are not being logged**: Make sure you have correctly configured the custom exception handler and that the `$log` service is properly injected.\n\n2. **Custom exception handler is not being used**: Double-check the configuration code and ensure that the custom exception handler is correctly provided as a dependency to the `$exceptionHandlerProvider`.\n\n### Best Practices and Recommendations\nTo effectively handle exceptions in your AngularJS application, consider the following best practices and recommendations:\n\n- Log exceptions to a centralized logging service for easier debugging and monitoring.\n\n- Display user-friendly error messages to provide a better user experience.\n\n- Use try-catch blocks in critical sections of your code to catch and handle exceptions.\n\n### Summary and Conclusion\nException handling is an essential part of any application development process. In this article, we discussed how to handle exceptions in AngularJS applications. We covered the necessary requirements and pre-requisites, provided step-by-step instructions, code snippets, troubleshooting tips, and best practices. By following these guidelines, you can handle exceptions effectively in your AngularJS applications and provide a better user experience."
