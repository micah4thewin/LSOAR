One of its key features is the ability to filter and sort data easily. In this documentation, we will explore how to use filters and sorting in AngularJS to manipulate and display data in a user-friendly way.\n\n### Objective and Scope\nThe objective of this documentation is to provide a step-by-step guide on how to use filters and sorting in AngularJS. We will cover the basic concepts of filters and sorting, as well as provide code examples and best practices. The scope of this documentation is limited to AngularJS version 1.x.\n\n### Requirements and Pre-requisites\nTo follow along with the examples in this documentation, you will need the following:\n\n- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript\n- AngularJS library (version 1.x) included in your project\n- A text editor or IDE for writing code\n\n### Step-by-Step Instructions\n1. **Adding AngularJS to your project**: Before you can start using AngularJS filters and sorting, you need to include the AngularJS library in your project. You can download it from the official AngularJS website or include it via a CDN. Add the following script tag to your HTML file:\n\n```html\n<script src=\"path/to/angular.js\"></script>\n```\n\n2. **Creating an AngularJS module**: To use AngularJS filters and sorting, you need to create an AngularJS module. In your JavaScript file, add the following code:\n\n```javascript\nvar app = angular.module('myApp', []);\n```\n\n3. **Defining a controller**: Next, you need to define a controller within your AngularJS module. This controller will be responsible for managing the data and applying filters and sorting. Add the following code to your JavaScript file:\n\n```javascript\napp.controller('myController', function($scope) {\n  // Controller logic goes here\n});\n```\n\n4. **Binding data to the view**: To display data in your AngularJS application, you need to bind it to the view. In your HTML file, add the following code:\n\n```html\n<div ng-controller=\"myController\">\n  <ul>\n    <li ng-repeat=\"item in items\">{{ item }}</li>\n  </ul>\n</div>\n```\n\n5. **Adding filters**: AngularJS provides a set of built-in filters that you can use to manipulate the displayed data. To apply a filter, use the `filter` directive in your HTML file. For example, to filter a list of names based on a search term, add the following code:\n\n```html\n<input type=\"text\" ng-model=\"searchTerm\">\n<ul>\n  <li ng-repeat=\"name in names | filter:searchTerm\">{{ name }}</li>\n</ul>\n```\n\n6. **Sorting data**: AngularJS also provides sorting capabilities. To sort a list of items, use the `orderBy` filter in your HTML file. For example, to sort a list of numbers in ascending order, add the following code:\n\n```html\n<ul>\n  <li ng-repeat=\"number in numbers | orderBy\">{{ number }}</li>\n</ul>\n```\n\n### Code Snippets and Commands\n- **Adding AngularJS to your project**:\n\n```html\n<script src=\"path/to/angular.js\"></script>\n```\n\n- **Creating an AngularJS module**:\n\n```javascript\nvar app = angular.module('myApp', []);\n```\n\n- **Defining a controller**:\n\n```javascript\napp.controller('myController', function($scope) {\n  // Controller logic goes here\n});\n```\n\n- **Binding data to the view**:\n\n```html\n<div ng-controller=\"myController\">\n  <ul>\n    <li ng-repeat=\"item in items\">{{ item }}</li>\n  </ul>\n</div>\n```\n\n- **Adding filters**:\n\n```html\n<input type=\"text\" ng-model=\"searchTerm\">\n<ul>\n  <li ng-repeat=\"name in names | filter:searchTerm\">{{ name }}</li>\n</ul>\n```\n\n- **Sorting data**:\n\n```html\n<ul>\n  <li ng-repeat=\"number in numbers | orderBy\">{{ number }}</li>\n</ul>\n```\n\n### Troubleshooting and Common Issues\n- If the filters or sorting are not working as expected, make sure you have included the AngularJS library correctly and that your module and controller are set up properly.\n- Check for any errors in the browser console that may indicate issues with your code.\n- Make sure you are using the correct syntax for filters and sorting in your HTML file.\n\n### Best Practices and Recommendations\n- Use filters sparingly and avoid applying multiple filters on the same data, as it can impact performance.\n- When sorting data, consider using a custom sorting function to handle complex sorting requirements.\n- Keep your code organized by separating the filter and sorting logic into separate functions or services.\n- Test your filters and sorting functionality thoroughly to ensure it behaves as expected in different scenarios.\n\n### Summary and Conclusion\nIn this documentation, we have explored how to use filters and sorting in AngularJS to manipulate and display data. We covered the basic concepts, provided step-by-step instructions, and shared best practices and recommendations. By following these guidelines, you can enhance the user experience of your AngularJS applications by effectively filtering and sorting data."
