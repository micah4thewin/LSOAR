It allows developers to build dynamic and responsive web applications. In this documentation, we will explore how to build realtime applications using AngularJS.\n\n### Objective and Scope\nThe objective of this documentation is to provide a step-by-step guide on building realtime applications with AngularJS. We will cover the necessary requirements, pre-requisites, and provide code snippets and commands to help you get started. Additionally, we will discuss common issues and provide troubleshooting tips, as well as best practices and recommendations for optimal performance and security.\n\n### Requirements and Pre-requisites\nBefore getting started, ensure that you have the following requirements and pre-requisites in place:\n\n1. Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.\n2. Node.js installed on your machine.\n3. AngularJS framework installed.\n\n### Step-by-Step Instructions\nFollow these step-by-step instructions to build realtime applications with AngularJS:\n\n1. Create a new AngularJS project using the Angular CLI:\n   ```bash\n   ng new realtime-app\n   ```\n\n2. Navigate to the project directory:\n   ```bash\n   cd realtime-app\n   ```\n\n3. Install the necessary dependencies:\n   ```bash\n   npm install firebase angularfire2 --save\n   ```\n\n4. Import the AngularFireModule and initialize it with your Firebase configuration in the app.module.ts file:\n   ```typescript\n   import { AngularFireModule } from 'angularfire2';\n   import { environment } from '../environments/environment';\n\n   @NgModule({\n     imports: [\n       AngularFireModule.initializeApp(environment.firebaseConfig),\n     ],\n     ...\n   })\n   export class AppModule { }\n   ```\n\n5. Create a new component for your realtime application:\n   ```bash\n   ng generate component realtime\n   ```\n\n6. In the realtime.component.ts file, import the necessary AngularFire modules and inject them into the constructor:\n   ```typescript\n   import { AngularFireDatabase } from 'angularfire2/database';\n   import { Observable } from 'rxjs';\n\n   export class RealtimeComponent {\n     items: Observable<any[]>;\n\n     constructor(private db: AngularFireDatabase) {\n       this.items = db.list('items').valueChanges();\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n7. Update the realtime.component.html file to display the realtime data:\n   ```html\n   <ul>\n     <li *ngFor=\"let item of items | async\">\n       {{ item.name }}\n     </li>\n   </ul>\n   ```\n\n8. Start the development server:\n   ```bash\n   ng serve\n   ```\n\n9. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200 to see your realtime application in action.\n\n### Code Snippets and Commands\nHere are some code snippets and commands that you may find useful when building realtime applications with AngularJS:\n\n- To install Angular CLI:\n  ```bash\n  npm install -g @angular/cli\n  ```\n\n- To create a new AngularJS project:\n  ```bash\n  ng new project-name\n  ```\n\n- To generate a new component:\n  ```bash\n  ng generate component component-name\n  ```\n\n### Troubleshooting and Common Issues\nIf you encounter any issues while building realtime applications with AngularJS, here are some common problems and their solutions:\n\n1. **Firebase authentication error**: Make sure you have properly configured Firebase authentication in your project and that the API keys are correct.\n\n2. **Realtime data not updating**: Check if you are subscribing to the correct Firebase database node and that the data is being updated correctly.\n\n### Best Practices and Recommendations\nTo ensure optimal performance and security when building realtime applications with AngularJS, consider the following best practices and recommendations:\n\n1. Use Firebase security rules to restrict access to your realtime database.\n\n2. Implement proper error handling and validation in your application to handle any unexpected scenarios.\n\n### Summary and Conclusion\nIn this documentation, we explored how to build realtime applications using AngularJS. We covered the necessary requirements and pre-requisites, provided step-by-step instructions, code snippets, and commands. We also discussed common issues, troubleshooting tips, and best practices for optimal performance and security. Now you can start building your own realtime applications with AngularJS. Happy coding!"
