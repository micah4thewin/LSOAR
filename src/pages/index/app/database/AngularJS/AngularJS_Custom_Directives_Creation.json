  "article": "## AngularJS Custom Directives Creation\n\n### Introduction\nAngularJS is a powerful JavaScript framework that allows developers to build dynamic web applications. One of its key features is the ability to create custom directives, which are reusable components that can be used to extend HTML and add custom functionality. In this article, we will explore how to create custom directives in AngularJS.\n\n### Objective and Scope\nThe objective of this documentation is to provide step-by-step instructions on creating custom directives in AngularJS. The scope of this documentation is limited to the creation of custom directives and does not cover other aspects of AngularJS development.\n\n### Requirements and Pre-requisites\nTo follow along with this documentation, you will need the following:\n\n- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.\n- An understanding of AngularJS concepts and syntax.\n- A code editor such as Visual Studio Code or Sublime Text.\n- AngularJS installed in your project.\n\n### Step-by-Step Instructions\n1. **Create a new AngularJS project**: Start by creating a new AngularJS project using the `ng new` command. This will generate a basic project structure with all the necessary files.\n\n2. **Create a new directive file**: In the project directory, create a new file for your custom directive. Name it something descriptive, such as `myDirective.js`.\n\n3. **Define the directive**: In the `myDirective.js` file, define your custom directive using the `angular.module` function. Provide a unique name for your directive and specify the function that will be executed when the directive is used.\n\n   ```javascript\n   angular.module('myApp').directive('myDirective', function() {\n       return {\n           restrict: 'E',\n           template: '<div>This is my custom directive</div>',\n           link: function(scope, element, attrs) {\n               // Add custom functionality here\n           }\n       };\n   });\n   ```\n\n4. **Include the directive in your HTML**: To use your custom directive, include it in your HTML file using the element name you specified in the directive definition.\n\n   ```html\n   <my-directive></my-directive>\n   ```\n\n5. **Test your directive**: Run your AngularJS project and open it in a web browser. You should see the output of your custom directive displayed on the page.\n\n### Code Snippets and Commands\n- `ng new myApp`: Creates a new AngularJS project named \"myApp\".\n- `angular.module('myApp').directive('myDirective', function() { ... })`: Defines a custom directive named \"myDirective\" in the \"myApp\" module.\n\n### Troubleshooting and Common Issues\n- Make sure you have included the AngularJS library in your project.\n- Check for any syntax errors in your directive definition.\n- Verify that you have correctly included the directive in your HTML file.\n\n### Best Practices and Recommendations\n- Use a unique and descriptive name for your custom directive to avoid naming conflicts.\n- Keep your directive code modular and reusable.\n- Follow AngularJS best practices and coding conventions.\n- Test your directive thoroughly to ensure it works as expected.\n\n### Summary and Conclusion\nCreating custom directives in AngularJS allows you to extend HTML and add custom functionality to your web applications. By following the step-by-step instructions in this documentation, you should now have a good understanding of how to create custom directives in AngularJS. Experiment with different directive configurations and explore the possibilities of customizing your web applications with AngularJS."
