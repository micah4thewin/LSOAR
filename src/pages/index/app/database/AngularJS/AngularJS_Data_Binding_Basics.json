One of its key features is data binding, which allows you to automatically synchronize data between the model and the view. This documentation will cover the basics of data binding in AngularJS.\n\n### Objective and Scope\nThe objective of this documentation is to provide a thorough understanding of AngularJS data binding and how to use it effectively in your applications. The scope of this documentation is limited to the basic concepts and implementation of data binding in AngularJS.\n\n### Requirements and Pre-requisites\nTo follow along with the examples in this documentation, you will need the following:\n\n- A basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.\n- A text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) to write code.\n- AngularJS library included in your project. You can download it from the official website or include it via a content delivery network (CDN).\n\n### Step-by-Step Instructions\n1. Create an HTML file and include the AngularJS library.\n   ```html\n   <!DOCTYPE html>\n   <html>\n   <head>\n       <script src=\"https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.7.9/angular.min.js\"></script>\n   </head>\n   <body>\n       <!-- Your code goes here -->\n   </body>\n   </html>\n   ```\n\n2. Add an AngularJS module to your application.\n   ```html\n   <body ng-app=\"myApp\">\n   ```\n\n3. Define a controller in your module.\n   ```html\n   <body ng-app=\"myApp\" ng-controller=\"myCtrl\">\n   ```\n\n4. Bind data from the controller to the view using AngularJS directives.\n   ```html\n   <body ng-app=\"myApp\" ng-controller=\"myCtrl\">\n       <input type=\"text\" ng-model=\"name\">\n       <h1>Hello, {{name}}!</h1>\n   </body>\n   ```\n\n5. Define the controller in your JavaScript code.\n   ```html\n   <script>\n   var app = angular.module('myApp', []);\n   app.controller('myCtrl', function($scope) {\n       $scope.name = 'John Doe';\n   });\n   </script>\n   ```\n\n6. Open the HTML file in a web browser and test the data binding. The input field should be pre-filled with \"John Doe\", and any changes made to the input field should update the displayed name dynamically.\n\n### Code Snippets and Commands\n- To include the AngularJS library in your HTML file, use the following script tag:\n  ```html\n  <script src=\"https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.7.9/angular.min.js\"></script>\n  ```\n\n- To define an AngularJS module, use the `ng-app` directive in the HTML tag:\n  ```html\n  <html ng-app=\"myApp\">\n  ```\n\n- To define an AngularJS controller, use the `ng-controller` directive in the HTML tag:\n  ```html\n  <body ng-app=\"myApp\" ng-controller=\"myCtrl\">\n  ```\n\n- To bind data from the controller to the view, use the `ng-model` directive in the HTML tag:\n  ```html\n  <input type=\"text\" ng-model=\"name\">\n  ```\n\n- To display the bound data in the view, use double curly braces `{{}}` with the variable name:\n  ```html\n  <h1>Hello, {{name}}!</h1>\n  ```\n\n### Troubleshooting and Common Issues\n- Make sure the AngularJS library is included correctly in your HTML file.\n- Check for any JavaScript errors in the browser console.\n- Ensure that the module and controller names are spelled correctly and match in both the HTML and JavaScript code.\n- Verify that the AngularJS directives are used correctly in the HTML code.\n\n### Best Practices and Recommendations\n- Use descriptive variable names to improve code readability.\n- Avoid excessive use of data binding, as it can impact performance.\n- Keep the controller logic separate from the view to improve code maintainability.\n- Use AngularJS's two-way data binding sparingly, as it can make code harder to understand and debug.\n\n### Summary and Conclusion\nData binding is a powerful feature in AngularJS that allows you to synchronize data between the model and the view effortlessly. By following the step-by-step instructions provided in this documentation, you should now have a good understanding of how to implement basic data binding in AngularJS. Remember to refer to the code snippets and commands section for quick reference. Keep practicing and exploring more advanced concepts to become proficient in AngularJS data binding."
