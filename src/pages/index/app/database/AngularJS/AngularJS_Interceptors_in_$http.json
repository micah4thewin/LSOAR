This feature is particularly useful for tasks such as adding headers to requests, handling authentication, logging, and error handling.\n\n### Objective and Scope\nThe objective of this document is to provide a comprehensive guide on how to use interceptors in AngularJS's $http service. The scope of this document covers the basic concepts of interceptors, their configuration, and implementation.\n\n### Requirements and Pre-requisites\nTo follow along with this guide, you will need the following:\n- Basic knowledge of AngularJS\n- An AngularJS project set up with the $http service\n\n### Step-by-Step Instructions\n1. Create an interceptor factory function:\n   ```javascript\n   angular.module('myApp')\n     .factory('myInterceptor', function() {\n       var interceptor = {\n         request: function(config) {\n           // Modify the request config here\n           return config;\n         },\n         response: function(response) {\n           // Modify the response here\n           return response;\n         },\n         requestError: function(rejection) {\n           // Handle request error here\n           return rejection;\n         },\n         responseError: function(rejection) {\n           // Handle response error here\n           return rejection;\n         }\n       };\n       return interceptor;\n     });\n   ```\n\n2. Configure the interceptor in your AngularJS module's config block:\n   ```javascript\n   angular.module('myApp')\n     .config(function($httpProvider) {\n       $httpProvider.interceptors.push('myInterceptor');\n     });\n   ```\n\n3. Use the $http service as usual, and the interceptor will automatically intercept the requests and responses.\n\n### Code Snippets and Commands\n- To create an interceptor factory function:\n  ```javascript\n  angular.module('myApp')\n    .factory('myInterceptor', function() {\n      // Interceptor implementation here\n    });\n  ```\n\n- To configure the interceptor in your AngularJS module's config block:\n  ```javascript\n  angular.module('myApp')\n    .config(function($httpProvider) {\n      $httpProvider.interceptors.push('myInterceptor');\n    });\n  ```\n\n### Troubleshooting and Common Issues\n- Make sure you have correctly configured the interceptor in your AngularJS module's config block.\n- Check for any syntax errors or typos in your interceptor implementation.\n- Ensure that the interceptor is registered with the correct module.\n\n### Best Practices and Recommendations\n- Use interceptors sparingly and only for tasks that are necessary for all or most HTTP requests.\n- Keep your interceptor logic concise and focused on its specific task.\n- Avoid modifying the request or response excessively, as it can impact performance.\n\n### Summary and Conclusion\nInterceptors in AngularJS's $http service provide a powerful way to intercept and modify HTTP requests and responses. By following the steps outlined in this document, you can easily implement interceptors in your AngularJS application to handle tasks such as adding headers, handling authentication, logging, and error handling. Remember to use interceptors judiciously and keep the logic concise for optimal performance."
