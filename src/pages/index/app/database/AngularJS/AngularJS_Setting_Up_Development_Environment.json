  "article": "## AngularJS: Setting Up Development Environment\n\n### Introduction\nThis document provides a step-by-step guide on how to set up a development environment for AngularJS. It includes instructions, code snippets, and recommendations to help you get started with AngularJS development.\n\n### Objective and Scope\nThe objective of this document is to help developers set up a development environment for AngularJS. It covers the installation of necessary software and tools, as well as configuration and setup steps. The scope of this document is limited to setting up the development environment and does not cover advanced topics or specific project requirements.\n\n### Requirements and Pre-requisites\nBefore setting up the development environment for AngularJS, make sure you have the following requirements and pre-requisites:\n\n- Node.js: AngularJS requires Node.js to run. Install Node.js from the official website: [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)\n\n- Package Manager: AngularJS uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage dependencies. npm is installed automatically with Node.js.\n\n### Step-by-Step Instructions\nFollow these step-by-step instructions to set up your development environment for AngularJS:\n\n1. Install Node.js: Download and install Node.js from the official website. Follow the installation instructions provided for your operating system.\n\n2. Verify Node.js installation: Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command to verify that Node.js is installed correctly:\n\n   ```\n   node -v\n   ```\n\n   This command should display the version number of Node.js installed.\n\n3. Install Angular CLI: Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install Angular CLI globally:\n\n   ```\n   npm install -g @angular/cli\n   ```\n\n   This command installs the Angular CLI package globally on your system.\n\n4. Verify Angular CLI installation: Run the following command to verify that Angular CLI is installed correctly:\n\n   ```\n   ng version\n   ```\n\n   This command should display the version number of Angular CLI installed.\n\n5. Create a new Angular project: Run the following command to create a new Angular project:\n\n   ```\n   ng new my-angular-app\n   ```\n\n   Replace `my-angular-app` with the desired name for your project.\n\n6. Change directory to the project folder: Navigate to the project folder using the following command:\n\n   ```\n   cd my-angular-app\n   ```\n\n   Replace `my-angular-app` with the name of your project.\n\n7. Start the development server: Run the following command to start the development server:\n\n   ```\n   ng serve\n   ```\n\n   This command compiles the project and starts a local development server. You can access your Angular app in a web browser at `http://localhost:4200`.\n\n8. Congratulations! You have successfully set up your development environment for AngularJS.\n\n### Code Snippets and Commands\nHere are some useful code snippets and commands related to setting up the development environment for AngularJS:\n\n- Verify Node.js installation:\n  ```\n  node -v\n  ```\n\n- Install Angular CLI:\n  ```\n  npm install -g @angular/cli\n  ```\n\n- Verify Angular CLI installation:\n  ```\n  ng version\n  ```\n\n- Create a new Angular project:\n  ```\n  ng new my-angular-app\n  ```\n\n- Change directory to the project folder:\n  ```\n  cd my-angular-app\n  ```\n\n- Start the development server:\n  ```\n  ng serve\n  ```\n\n### Troubleshooting and Common Issues\nIf you encounter any issues while setting up your development environment for AngularJS, try the following troubleshooting steps:\n\n- Verify that Node.js is installed correctly by running `node -v` in a terminal or command prompt. If Node.js is not installed, download and install it from the official website.\n\n- Make sure you have administrative privileges to install global packages. On some systems, you may need to use `sudo` or run the command prompt as an administrator.\n\n- If you encounter any errors during the installation process, check the official documentation and community forums for solutions.\n\n### Best Practices and Recommendations\nHere are some best practices and recommendations for working with AngularJS:\n\n- Keep your development environment up to date by regularly updating Node.js and Angular CLI to the latest versions.\n\n- Use a version control system, such as Git, to track changes in your code and collaborate with other developers.\n\n- Follow AngularJS coding conventions and style guides to maintain consistent code quality and readability.\n\n- Use a code editor with AngularJS extensions or plugins to enhance your development workflow and productivity.\n\n### Summary and Conclusion\nIn this document, we have provided a detailed guide on setting up a development environment for AngularJS. We covered the installation of Node.js, Angular CLI, and the creation of a new Angular project. We also provided troubleshooting tips, best practices, and recommendations for working with AngularJS. By following these instructions, you should now have a fully functional development environment for AngularJS. Happy coding!"
