It provides a set of tools and features that simplify the development process and enhance the user experience. This documentation will guide you through the process of creating your first AngularJS application.\n\n### Objective and Scope\nThe objective of this documentation is to provide a step-by-step walkthrough of creating a basic AngularJS application. The scope of this documentation covers the installation process, setting up a development environment, and creating a simple application with AngularJS.\n\n### Requirements and Pre-requisites\nBefore you begin, make sure you have the following requirements and pre-requisites in place:\n\n- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.\n- A text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) to write code.\n- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine.\n\n### Step-by-Step Instructions\nFollow these step-by-step instructions to create your first AngularJS application:\n\n1. Install Node.js and npm if you haven't already. You can download them from the official Node.js website (https://nodejs.org).\n\n2. Open your terminal or command prompt and check if Node.js and npm are installed correctly by running the following commands:\n   ```\n   node -v\n   npm -v\n   ```\n\n3. Create a new directory for your AngularJS application. You can choose any name for the directory.\n\n4. Navigate to the newly created directory using the terminal or command prompt:\n   ```\n   cd /path/to/your/directory\n   ```\n\n5. Initialize a new npm project by running the following command:\n   ```\n   npm init -y\n   ```\n\n6. Install AngularJS as a dependency for your project by running the following command:\n   ```\n   npm install angular\n   ```\n\n7. Create a new HTML file in your project directory and open it in your text editor or IDE.\n\n8. Add the following code to the HTML file to include the AngularJS library:\n   ```html\n   <script src=\"node_modules/angular/angular.js\"></script>\n   ```\n\n9. Create a new JavaScript file in your project directory and open it in your text editor or IDE.\n\n10. Add the following code to the JavaScript file to define your AngularJS application module:\n    ```javascript\n    var app = angular.module('myApp', []);\n    ```\n\n11. Add the following code to the JavaScript file to define a controller for your application:\n    ```javascript\n    app.controller('myController', function($scope) {\n      $scope.message = 'Hello, AngularJS!';\n    });\n    ```\n\n12. Update the HTML file to include the AngularJS application module and controller:\n    ```html\n    <body ng-app=\"myApp\">\n      <div ng-controller=\"myController\">\n        <h1>{{ message }}</h1>\n      </div>\n    </body>\n    ```\n\n13. Save the changes to your HTML and JavaScript files.\n\n14. Open the HTML file in a web browser to see your AngularJS application in action.\n\n### Code Snippets and Commands\nHere are some code snippets and commands that you may find useful during the process:\n\n- Install Node.js and npm:\n  ```\n  node -v\n  npm -v\n  ```\n\n- Initialize a new npm project:\n  ```\n  npm init -y\n  ```\n\n- Install AngularJS:\n  ```\n  npm install angular\n  ```\n\n### Troubleshooting and Common Issues\nIf you encounter any issues during the process, here are some common troubleshooting steps:\n\n- Make sure Node.js and npm are installed correctly.\n- Check if the AngularJS library is included correctly in your HTML file.\n- Verify that the AngularJS module and controller are defined correctly in your JavaScript file.\n- Inspect the browser console for any error messages.\n\n### Best Practices and Recommendations\nTo make the most out of AngularJS, consider the following best practices and recommendations:\n\n- Follow the AngularJS style guide to write clean and maintainable code.\n- Use AngularJS directives and built-in features whenever possible to avoid reinventing the wheel.\n- Optimize your application performance by minimizing DOM manipulation and using AngularJS features like data binding and dependency injection.\n- Secure your application by implementing proper input validation and sanitization.\n\n### Summary and Conclusion\nIn this walkthrough, you learned how to create your first AngularJS application. You installed the necessary tools, set up a development environment, and created a simple application with AngularJS. You also learned about some best practices and recommendations for building AngularJS applications. Now you can continue exploring AngularJS and building more complex applications."
