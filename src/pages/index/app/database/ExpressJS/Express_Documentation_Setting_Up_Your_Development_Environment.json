It provides a simple, yet powerful set of features for building web applications and APIs. This documentation will guide you through the process of setting up your development environment for Express.js.\n\n## Objective and Scope\nThe objective of this documentation is to help developers set up their development environment for Express.js. It will cover the necessary requirements and pre-requisites, provide step-by-step instructions, and offer best practices and recommendations for optimal development experience.\n\n## Requirements and Pre-requisites\nTo set up your development environment for Express.js, you will need the following:\n\n- Node.js: Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from the official Node.js website.\n\n## Step-by-Step Instructions\nFollow these step-by-step instructions to set up your development environment for Express.js:\n\n1. Open your terminal or command prompt.\n2. Check if Node.js is installed by running the following command:\n   ```\n   node -v\n   ```\n   This will display the installed version of Node.js. If you see a version number, it means Node.js is installed.\n3. Create a new directory for your Express.js project by running the following command:\n   ```\n   mkdir my-express-project\n   ```\n   Replace `my-express-project` with the desired name of your project.\n4. Navigate into the newly created directory:\n   ```\n   cd my-express-project\n   ```\n5. Initialize a new Node.js project by running the following command:\n   ```\n   npm init -y\n   ```\n   This will create a `package.json` file in your project directory.\n6. Install Express.js as a dependency by running the following command:\n   ```\n   npm install express\n   ```\n   This will download and install the latest version of Express.js in your project.\n7. Create a new file called `index.js` in your project directory and open it in a text editor.\n8. Import Express.js and create an instance of the Express application:\n   ```javascript\n   const express = require('express');\n   const app = express();\n   ```\n9. Define a route for the root URL (\"/\") and send a response:\n   ```javascript\n   app.get('/', (req, res) => {\n     res.send('Hello, Express!');\n   });\n   ```\n10. Start the Express application by listening on a specific port:\n    ```javascript\n    const port = 3000;\n    app.listen(port, () => {\n      console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);\n    });\n    ```\n11. Save the changes to `index.js`.\n12. Run the Express application by executing the following command:\n    ```\n    node index.js\n    ```\n13. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. You should see the message \"Hello, Express!\".\n\n## Code Snippets and Commands\nHere are some relevant code snippets and commands for setting up your development environment with Express.js:\n\n- Checking Node.js version:\n  ```\n  node -v\n  ```\n\n- Creating a new directory:\n  ```\n  mkdir my-express-project\n  ```\n\n- Navigating into a directory:\n  ```\n  cd my-express-project\n  ```\n\n- Initializing a new Node.js project:\n  ```\n  npm init -y\n  ```\n\n- Installing Express.js:\n  ```\n  npm install express\n  ```\n\n- Running the Express application:\n  ```\n  node index.js\n  ```\n\n## Troubleshooting and Common Issues\n- If you encounter an error stating that the `node` command is not recognized, make sure Node.js is properly installed and added to your system's PATH environment variable.\n\n## Best Practices and Recommendations\n- Use a version control system like Git to track your project's changes and collaborate with others.\n- Use a code editor or integrated development environment (IDE) that supports Node.js and JavaScript for a better development experience.\n- Follow the Express.js documentation and community guidelines for best practices and coding standards.\n\n## Summary and Conclusion\nSetting up your development environment for Express.js is a straightforward process. By following the step-by-step instructions in this documentation, you should now have a basic Express.js application running on your local machine. Remember to consult the Express.js documentation and community resources for further information and advanced usage. Happy coding!"
