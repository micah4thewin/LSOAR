  "article": "## Introduction\n\nExpress.js is a popular web application framework for Node.js, designed to build efficient and scalable web applications and APIs. It provides a simple and minimalistic approach to web development, allowing developers to focus on writing clean and maintainable code. Express.js is widely used for creating server-side rendered (SSR) applications, where the server generates the HTML content and sends it to the client.\n\nThis documentation aims to provide a comprehensive guide on using Express.js for server-side rendering. It covers the objectives and scope of the documentation, the requirements and pre-requisites, step-by-step instructions, code snippets and commands, troubleshooting and common issues, best practices and recommendations, and a summary and conclusion.\n\n## Objective and Scope\n\nThe objective of this documentation is to help developers understand how to use Express.js for server-side rendering. It covers the necessary requirements and pre-requisites, provides detailed step-by-step instructions, includes relevant code snippets and commands, offers solutions to common issues, and provides best practices and recommendations for optimal performance and security.\n\nThe scope of this documentation is limited to using Express.js for server-side rendering. It does not cover other topics such as client-side rendering, database integration, or authentication and authorization.\n\n## Requirements and Pre-requisites\n\nBefore proceeding with using Express.js for server-side rendering, ensure that you have the following requirements and pre-requisites in place:\n\n- Node.js installed on your machine.\n- Basic knowledge of JavaScript and Node.js.\n- Familiarity with HTML and CSS.\n- A text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) for writing code.\n\n## Step-by-Step Instructions\n\nFollow these step-by-step instructions to use Express.js for server-side rendering:\n\n1. Create a new directory for your Express.js project.\n2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.\n3. Initialize a new Node.js project by running the command `npm init`.\n4. Install Express.js as a dependency by running the command `npm install express`.\n5. Create a new file named `server.js` in the project directory.\n6. Open `server.js` in your text editor or IDE.\n7. Import the Express.js module by adding the following line of code at the top of the file: `const express = require('express');`.\n8. Create a new Express.js application by adding the following line of code: `const app = express();`.\n9. Define a route for the home page by adding the following code: \n```javascript\napp.get('/', (req, res) => {\n  res.send('Hello, World!');\n});\n```\n10. Start the Express.js server by adding the following code at the end of the file: `app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server started on port 3000'));`.\n11. Save the changes to `server.js`.\n12. Run the command `node server.js` in the terminal to start the Express.js server.\n13. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the \"Hello, World!\" message.\n\nThese instructions provide a basic example of using Express.js for server-side rendering. You can customize and extend the functionality as per your requirements.\n\n## Code Snippets and Commands\n\nHere are some relevant code snippets and commands for using Express.js for server-side rendering:\n\n- Installing Express.js: `npm install express`\n- Importing Express.js: `const express = require('express');`\n- Creating a new Express.js application: `const app = express();`\n- Defining a route: \n```javascript\napp.get('/', (req, res) => {\n  res.send('Hello, World!');\n});\n```\n- Starting the server: `app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server started on port 3000'));`\n- Running the Express.js server: `node server.js`\n\nFeel free to modify and adapt these code snippets and commands as needed for your specific use case.\n\n## Troubleshooting and Common Issues\n\nIf you encounter any issues or errors while using Express.js for server-side rendering, here are some common troubleshooting steps:\n\n- Ensure that you have installed Express.js as a dependency in your project.\n- Check for any syntax errors or typos in your code.\n- Verify that the required packages and modules are correctly imported.\n- Restart the Express.js server and try again.\n- Consult the official Express.js documentation or community forums for further assistance.\n\nIf the issue persists, provide the relevant error message and code snippets when seeking help to facilitate a quicker resolution.\n\n## Best Practices and Recommendations\n\nTo ensure optimal performance and security when using Express.js for server-side rendering, consider the following best practices and recommendations:\n\n- Follow the modular approach by dividing your code into separate files and modules for better maintainability.\n- Implement error handling middleware to gracefully handle any runtime errors or exceptions.\n- Use environment variables to store sensitive information such as database credentials or API keys.\n- Implement input validation and sanitization to prevent security vulnerabilities.\n- Use a logging library to log important events and errors for debugging purposes.\n- Regularly update your dependencies and keep your Express.js version up to date to benefit from the latest features and security patches.\n\nFollowing these best practices will help you build robust and secure server-side rendered applications using Express.js.\n\n## Summary and Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, Express.js is a powerful web application framework for Node.js that can be used for server-side rendering. This documentation provided an overview of Express.js and its capabilities, outlined the objectives and scope of the documentation, listed the requirements and pre-requisites, offered step-by-step instructions, provided relevant code snippets and commands, discussed troubleshooting and common issues, and shared best practices and recommendations.\n\nBy following the instructions and best practices outlined in this documentation, you should be able to use Express.js effectively for server-side rendering and build scalable and efficient web applications and APIs. Remember to refer to the official Express.js documentation and community resources for further information and support. Happy coding!"
