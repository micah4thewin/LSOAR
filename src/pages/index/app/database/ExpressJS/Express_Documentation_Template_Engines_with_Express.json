It provides a robust set of features for building web applications and APIs. One of the key features of Express is its support for template engines, which allow you to dynamically generate HTML pages and render them with data from your server.\n\n### Objective and Scope\nThe objective of this documentation is to provide a comprehensive guide on using template engines with Express. It will cover the different template engines supported by Express, how to install and configure them, and how to use them to render dynamic views in your Express application.\n\n### Requirements and Pre-requisites\nTo follow along with this documentation, you will need the following:\n- Node.js installed on your machine\n- Basic knowledge of JavaScript and web development concepts\n- Familiarity with Express.js\n\n### Step-by-Step Instructions\n1. Choose a template engine: Express supports a variety of template engines, including EJS, Pug, and Handlebars. Choose the one that best suits your needs.\n2. Install the template engine: Use npm to install the template engine package. For example, to install EJS, run `npm install ejs`.\n3. Configure Express to use the template engine: In your Express application, import the template engine and configure Express to use it. For example, to use EJS, add the following code:\n   ```javascript\n   const express = require('express');\n   const app = express();\n\n   app.set('view engine', 'ejs');\n   ```\n4. Create a view file: Create a file with the extension supported by your chosen template engine (e.g., `.ejs` for EJS). This file will contain the HTML structure and the dynamic content placeholders.\n5. Render the view: In your Express route handler, use the `res.render()` method to render the view file and pass any necessary data. For example:\n   ```javascript\n   app.get('/', (req, res) => {\n     const data = { name: 'John Doe' };\n     res.render('index', data);\n   });\n   ```\n6. Access dynamic data in the view: In your view file, use the template engine's syntax to access the dynamic data passed from the server. For example, in EJS, you can use `<%= name %>` to display the value of the `name` property from the `data` object.\n\n### Code Snippets and Commands\n- Install EJS template engine: `npm install ejs`\n- Configure Express to use EJS:\n  ```javascript\n  const express = require('express');\n  const app = express();\n\n  app.set('view engine', 'ejs');\n  ```\n- Render a view using EJS:\n  ```javascript\n  app.get('/', (req, res) => {\n    const data = { name: 'John Doe' };\n    res.render('index', data);\n  });\n  ```\n\n### Troubleshooting and Common Issues\n- Make sure you have installed the required template engine package using npm.\n- Double-check your Express configuration to ensure that you have set the correct view engine.\n- Verify that your view file has the correct extension and is located in the correct directory.\n- Check for any syntax errors or typos in your view file.\n\n### Best Practices and Recommendations\n- Choose a template engine that aligns with your project's requirements and your familiarity with its syntax.\n- Keep your view files organized in a separate directory for better maintainability.\n- Use partials or layout files to reuse common parts of your views.\n- Sanitize user input before rendering it in your views to prevent XSS attacks.\n\n### Summary and Conclusion\nIn this documentation, we have covered the basics of using template engines with Express. We discussed the objective and scope, requirements, step-by-step instructions, code snippets, troubleshooting tips, and best practices. With this knowledge, you should be able to use template engines effectively in your Express applications to create dynamic and interactive web pages."
