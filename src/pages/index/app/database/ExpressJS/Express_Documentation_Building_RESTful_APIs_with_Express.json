It provides a simple and flexible way to build web applications and APIs. In this documentation, we will explore how to build RESTful APIs using Express.js.\n\n### Objective and Scope\nThe objective of this documentation is to guide you through the process of building RESTful APIs with Express.js. We will cover the basic concepts of RESTful APIs, how to set up an Express.js project, and how to implement the CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for a resource.\n\n### Requirements and Pre-requisites\nBefore getting started, make sure you have the following requirements and pre-requisites:\n- Node.js installed on your machine\n- Basic knowledge of JavaScript and Node.js\n\n### Step-by-Step Instructions\n1. Create a new directory for your project:\n   ```shell\n   mkdir my-express-api\n   cd my-express-api\n   ```\n\n2. Initialize a new Node.js project:\n   ```shell\n   npm init -y\n   ```\n\n3. Install Express.js as a dependency:\n   ```shell\n   npm install express\n   ```\n\n4. Create a new file named `index.js` and open it in a code editor.\n\n5. Import the Express module and create an instance of the Express application:\n   ```javascript\n   const express = require('express');\n   const app = express();\n   ```\n\n6. Define the routes for your API:\n   ```javascript\n   app.get('/api/resource', (req, res) => {\n     // Handle GET request for resource\n   });\n\n   app.post('/api/resource', (req, res) => {\n     // Handle POST request for resource\n   });\n\n   app.put('/api/resource/:id', (req, res) => {\n     // Handle PUT request for resource with specified ID\n   });\n\n   app.delete('/api/resource/:id', (req, res) => {\n     // Handle DELETE request for resource with specified ID\n   });\n   ```\n\n7. Start the Express server and listen on a specific port:\n   ```javascript\n   const port = 3000;\n   app.listen(port, () => {\n     console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);\n   });\n   ```\n\n8. Test your API using a tool like Postman or curl.\n\n### Code Snippets and Commands\n- To install Express.js: `npm install express`\n- To start the Express server: `node index.js`\n\n### Troubleshooting and Common Issues\n- If you encounter any issues with installing or running Express.js, make sure you have Node.js installed and that you are in the correct directory when running the commands.\n\n### Best Practices and Recommendations\n- Use proper error handling and validation in your API routes.\n- Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure your API.\n- Use middleware functions to handle common tasks such as logging and request parsing.\n\n### Summary and Conclusion\nIn this documentation, we have covered the basics of building RESTful APIs with Express.js. We have learned how to set up an Express.js project, define routes for different CRUD operations, and start the Express server. By following these instructions and best practices, you can build robust and scalable APIs using Express.js."
