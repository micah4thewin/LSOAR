  "article": "## Introduction\n\nExpress.js is a fast and minimalist web application framework for Node.js. It provides a robust set of features for building web applications and APIs. In this documentation, we will explore how Express.js can be used to develop e-commerce applications.\n\n## Objective and Scope\n\nThe objective of this documentation is to provide a comprehensive guide on using Express.js for developing e-commerce applications. We will cover the necessary requirements, step-by-step instructions, code snippets, troubleshooting tips, and best practices.\n\nThe scope of this documentation includes setting up a basic Express.js application, integrating e-commerce functionality, implementing user authentication and authorization, handling payments, and managing product inventory.\n\n## Requirements and Pre-requisites\n\nBefore getting started with Express.js and e-commerce development, make sure you have the following requirements and pre-requisites in place:\n\n- Node.js installed on your machine\n- Basic knowledge of JavaScript and web development concepts\n- Familiarity with HTML, CSS, and database systems (such as MongoDB or MySQL)\n\n## Step-by-Step Instructions\n\n1. Install Express.js by running the following command in your terminal:\n```\nnpm install express\n```\n2. Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it:\n```\nmkdir ecommerce-app\ncd ecommerce-app\n```\n3. Initialize a new Node.js project:\n```\nnpm init -y\n```\n4. Install additional dependencies:\n```\nnpm install body-parser mongoose passport passport-local bcrypt\n```\n5. Create the main server file (e.g., `server.js`) and set up the Express.js application:\n```javascript\nconst express = require('express');\nconst app = express();\nconst port = 3000;\n\n// Middleware setup\napp.use(express.json());\napp.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: false }));\n\n// Routes setup\napp.get('/', (req, res) => {\n  res.send('Hello, World!');\n});\n\n// Start the server\napp.listen(port, () => {\n  console.log(`Server running on port ${port}`);\n});\n```\n6. Start the server by running the following command in your terminal:\n```\nnode server.js\n```\n7. Access the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000` and verify that \"Hello, World!\" is displayed.\n\n## Code Snippets and Commands\n\n- Example code for setting up a basic Express.js application:\n```javascript\nconst express = require('express');\nconst app = express();\nconst port = 3000;\n\napp.get('/', (req, res) => {\n  res.send('Hello, World!');\n});\n\napp.listen(port, () => {\n  console.log(`Server running on port ${port}`);\n});\n```\n\n- Command to install Express.js:\n```\nnpm install express\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting and Common Issues\n\n1. If you encounter an error stating that `express` is not recognized as a command, make sure you have installed it globally. You can install it globally by running the following command:\n```\nnpm install -g express\n```\n2. If you are unable to access the application in your browser, check if the server is running and if the correct port is specified in your code.\n\n## Best Practices and Recommendations\n\n- Use middleware to handle authentication and authorization.\n- Implement input validation and sanitization to prevent security vulnerabilities.\n- Separate your application into modular components for better maintainability.\n- Use a version control system (such as Git) to track changes in your codebase.\n- Deploy your application to a production server for optimal performance and security.\n\n## Summary and Conclusion\n\nIn this documentation, we have explored how Express.js can be used to develop e-commerce applications. We covered the necessary requirements, step-by-step instructions, code snippets, troubleshooting tips, and best practices.\n\nExpress.js provides a powerful and flexible framework for building web applications and APIs. With its extensive ecosystem of plugins and libraries, it is an excellent choice for developing e-commerce applications. By following the guidelines and best practices outlined in this documentation, you can create robust and secure e-commerce solutions using Express.js."
