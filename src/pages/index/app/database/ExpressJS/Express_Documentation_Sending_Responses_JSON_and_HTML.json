One of the key features of Express.js is its ability to send responses in various formats, including JSON and HTML. This documentation will guide you through the process of sending responses in JSON and HTML using Express.js.\n\n### Objective and Scope\nThe objective of this documentation is to provide step-by-step instructions on how to send responses in JSON and HTML using Express.js. The scope of this documentation covers the basic usage of Express.js for sending responses in JSON and HTML.\n\n### Requirements and Pre-requisites\nTo follow along with this documentation, you will need the following:\n- Node.js installed on your machine\n- Basic knowledge of JavaScript and web development concepts\n\n### Step-by-Step Instructions\n1. Install Express.js by running the following command in your terminal:\n   ```\n   npm install express\n   ```\n\n2. Create a new JavaScript file, for example, `app.js`, and require the Express module:\n   ```javascript\n   const express = require('express');\n   ```\n\n3. Create a new Express application:\n   ```javascript\n   const app = express();\n   ```\n\n4. Define a route that sends a JSON response:\n   ```javascript\n   app.get('/json', (req, res) => {\n     const data = {\n       message: 'Hello, World!'\n     };\n     res.json(data);\n   });\n   ```\n\n5. Define a route that sends an HTML response:\n   ```javascript\n   app.get('/html', (req, res) => {\n     const html = '<h1>Hello, World!</h1>';\n     res.send(html);\n   });\n   ```\n\n6. Start the Express server:\n   ```javascript\n   app.listen(3000, () => {\n     console.log('Server is running on port 3000');\n   });\n   ```\n\n7. Run the application by executing the following command in your terminal:\n   ```\n   node app.js\n   ```\n\n8. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000/json` to see the JSON response, or visit `http://localhost:3000/html` to see the HTML response.\n\n### Code Snippets and Commands\n- To install Express.js: `npm install express`\n- To start the Express server: `app.listen(port, callback)`\n- To send a JSON response: `res.json(data)`\n- To send an HTML response: `res.send(html)`\n\n### Troubleshooting and Common Issues\n- If you encounter any errors, make sure you have installed Express.js correctly and that there are no syntax errors in your code.\n- Check that you are running the application on the correct port and that there are no conflicts with other applications running on the same port.\n\n### Best Practices and Recommendations\n- Use the `res.json()` method to send JSON responses and the `res.send()` method to send HTML responses.\n- Validate and sanitize user input before sending responses to prevent security vulnerabilities.\n- Use proper error handling to handle any errors that may occur during the response sending process.\n\n### Summary and Conclusion\nSending responses in JSON and HTML using Express.js is a straightforward process. By following the step-by-step instructions provided in this documentation, you should now be able to send responses in JSON and HTML using Express.js. Remember to validate user input and handle errors properly to ensure the security and reliability of your web application."
