It provides a simple and flexible way to build web applications and APIs. One of the key features of Express.js is its routing system, which allows you to define routes for handling different HTTP requests.\n\n### Objective and Scope\nThe objective of this documentation is to help you understand the concept of routing in Express.js and how to use it effectively in your web applications. It covers the basic concepts of routing, as well as more advanced topics like route parameters, route handlers, and middleware.\n\n### Requirements and Pre-requisites\nTo follow along with this documentation, you will need the following:\n- Node.js installed on your machine\n- Basic knowledge of JavaScript and web development concepts\n\n### Step-by-Step Instructions\n1. Install Express.js by running the following command in your terminal:\n   ```\n   npm install express\n   ```\n2. Create a new Express.js application by creating a new file, for example, `app.js`.\n3. Import the Express.js module and create an instance of the Express application:\n   ```javascript\n   const express = require('express');\n   const app = express();\n   ```\n4. Define routes using the `app.get()`, `app.post()`, `app.put()`, `app.delete()`, or other HTTP methods provided by Express.js. For example:\n   ```javascript\n   app.get('/', (req, res) => {\n     res.send('Hello, World!');\n   });\n   ```\n5. Start the server and listen for incoming requests:\n   ```javascript\n   app.listen(3000, () => {\n     console.log('Server is running on port 3000');\n   });\n   ```\n6. Test your application by visiting `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.\n\n### Code Snippets and Commands\n- Example of a basic Express.js application:\n  ```javascript\n  const express = require('express');\n  const app = express();\n\n  app.get('/', (req, res) => {\n    res.send('Hello, World!');\n  });\n\n  app.listen(3000, () => {\n    console.log('Server is running on port 3000');\n  });\n  ```\n\n### Troubleshooting and Common Issues\n- If you encounter an error like \"Cannot find module 'express'\", make sure you have installed Express.js correctly using `npm install express`.\n- If your routes are not working as expected, check if you have defined the routes correctly and if there are any conflicts between routes.\n\n### Best Practices and Recommendations\n- Use meaningful route names and follow RESTful conventions when designing your routes.\n- Use route parameters to handle dynamic values in your routes.\n- Organize your routes into separate files or modules for better maintainability.\n- Use middleware functions to handle common tasks like authentication, logging, and error handling.\n\n### Summary and Conclusion\nUnderstanding Express routing is essential for building web applications with Express.js. By following this documentation, you have learned the basics of routing in Express.js and how to define routes for handling different HTTP requests. You have also gained knowledge about route parameters, route handlers, and middleware. With this knowledge, you can now start building powerful and flexible web applications using Express.js."
