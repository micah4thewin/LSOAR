  "article": "## Express Documentation: Handling HTTP Methods\n\n### Introduction\nExpress.js is a popular web application framework for Node.js that simplifies the process of building web applications. One of the key features of Express.js is its ability to handle different HTTP methods. This documentation will guide you through the process of handling HTTP methods in Express.js.\n\n### Objective and Scope\nThe objective of this documentation is to provide a step-by-step guide on how to handle various HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE in an Express.js application. The scope of this documentation is limited to handling HTTP methods using Express.js.\n\n### Requirements and Pre-requisites\nBefore proceeding with this documentation, make sure you have the following requirements and pre-requisites in place:\n\n- Node.js installed on your machine\n- Basic understanding of JavaScript and Node.js\n- Express.js installed in your project\n\n### Step-by-Step Instructions\nFollow these step-by-step instructions to handle HTTP methods in Express.js:\n\n1. Create a new Express.js application or open an existing one.\n2. Import the Express.js module into your application using the following code:\n\n```javascript\nconst express = require('express');\nconst app = express();\n```\n\n3. Define a route for the desired HTTP method using the `app.METHOD()` syntax, where METHOD is the HTTP method (e.g., `get`, `post`, `put`, `delete`). For example, to handle a GET request, use the following code:\n\n```javascript\napp.get('/', (req, res) => {\n  res.send('Hello, World!');\n});\n```\n\n4. Replace the `'/'` with the desired route path and the callback function with the desired functionality for that route.\n5. Repeat step 3 for each HTTP method you want to handle in your application.\n\n### Code Snippets and Commands\nHere are some useful code snippets and commands related to handling HTTP methods in Express.js:\n\n- To handle a POST request:\n\n```javascript\napp.post('/', (req, res) => {\n  res.send('Received a POST request');\n});\n```\n\n- To handle a PUT request:\n\n```javascript\napp.put('/', (req, res) => {\n  res.send('Received a PUT request');\n});\n```\n\n- To handle a DELETE request:\n\n```javascript\napp.delete('/', (req, res) => {\n  res.send('Received a DELETE request');\n});\n```\n\n### Troubleshooting and Common Issues\nIf you encounter any issues while handling HTTP methods in Express.js, consider the following troubleshooting steps:\n\n- Make sure you have properly installed Express.js in your project.\n- Check for any syntax errors in your code.\n- Verify that you are using the correct HTTP method in your route definition.\n\n### Best Practices and Recommendations\nTo effectively handle HTTP methods in Express.js, consider the following best practices and recommendations:\n\n- Use descriptive route paths to make your code more readable and maintainable.\n- Implement proper error handling for each HTTP method.\n- Organize your route handlers into separate modules for better code organization.\n\n### Summary and Conclusion\nHandling HTTP methods in Express.js is a fundamental aspect of building web applications. This documentation provided a step-by-step guide on how to handle different HTTP methods in Express.js. By following the instructions and best practices outlined in this documentation, you should be able to effectively handle HTTP methods in your Express.js applications."
