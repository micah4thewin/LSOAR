The city was initially named \"The Clearing\" due to the dense forest that covered the land. However, it was later renamed Portland after Portland, Maine, by one of its founders, Francis Pettygrove, in a coin toss.\n\nThe location of Portland played a crucial role in its early development. Situated at the confluence of the Willamette and Columbia Rivers, the city became a vital transportation hub for trade and commerce.
