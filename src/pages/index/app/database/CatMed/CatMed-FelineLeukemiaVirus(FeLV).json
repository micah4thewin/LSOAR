It is one of the most common infectious diseases in cats, and it can lead to various health issues, including immunosuppression, anemia, and cancer. Understanding how FeLV works is crucial for the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of this disease.\n\n## Key Terms\n- Feline Leukemia Virus (FeLV): A retrovirus that infects cats and can lead to various health problems.\n- Retrovirus: A type of virus that replicates by converting its RNA into DNA and integrating it into the host cell's genome.\n- Immunodeficiency: A condition in which the immune system is weakened, making the cat more susceptible to infections and diseases.\n\n## Detailed Explanation\nFeLV is primarily transmitted through close contact between infected and susceptible cats. The virus is shed in saliva, nasal secretions, urine, and feces of infected cats. It can be transmitted through mutual grooming, sharing food and water bowls, or through bites during fights.\n\nOnce the virus enters the cat's body, it targets and infects cells of the immune system, such as lymphocytes. FeLV is a retrovirus, meaning it can convert its RNA into DNA using the enzyme reverse transcriptase. This DNA is then integrated into the host cell's genome, allowing the virus to replicate and spread within the body.\n\nFeLV infection can have different outcomes in cats:\n1. Regressive infection: The cat's immune system successfully eliminates the virus, and the cat becomes immune to further FeLV infections.\n2. Progressive infection: The virus persists in the cat's body, leading to long-term health problems.\n\n## Concepts\n- FeLV is a retrovirus that infects and replicates within the cells of the immune system.\n- FeLV can be transmitted through close contact between infected and susceptible cats.\n- Cats can either clear the virus or develop a persistent infection.\n\n## Examples\nExample 1: Two cats living in the same household regularly groom each other. One of the cats is infected with FeLV, while the other is not. Through mutual grooming, the virus can be transmitted from the infected cat to the susceptible cat.\n\nExample 2: A stray cat with FeLV bites a healthy outdoor cat during a territorial dispute. The virus can be transmitted through the bite wound, potentially infecting the healthy cat.\n\n## Tips for Understanding\n- FeLV is primarily transmitted through close contact, such as grooming and sharing of food bowls.\n- Cats can be carriers of FeLV without showing any symptoms.\n- FeLV can weaken the immune system, making the cat more susceptible to other infections and diseases.\n\n## Questions and Answers\n1. Q: Can FeLV be transmitted from a mother cat to her kittens?\n   - A: Yes, FeLV can be transmitted from an infected mother cat to her kittens during pregnancy, birth, or through milk.\n\n2. Q: Is there a vaccine available for FeLV?\n   - A: Yes, there is a vaccine available for FeLV. It is recommended for cats at risk of exposure, such as outdoor cats or cats living with FeLV-positive cats.\n\n## Facts\n- FeLV is one of the leading causes of death in cats.\n- FeLV infection can lead to various health problems, including anemia, lymphoma, and immunodeficiency.\n- FeLV cannot infect humans or other species.\n\n## Summary Points\n- Feline Leukemia Virus (FeLV) is a retrovirus that infects cats and can lead to various health problems.\n- FeLV is primarily transmitted through close contact between infected and susceptible cats.\n- FeLV can weaken the immune system, making cats more susceptible to infections and diseases.\n- FeLV can be transmitted from a mother cat to her kittens.\n- Vaccination is available for FeLV and is recommended for cats at risk of exposure."
