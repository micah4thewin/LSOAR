It is characterized by inflammation of the gums (gingivitis) and damage to the tissues and structures supporting the teeth (periodontal disease). This condition can cause pain, discomfort, and even tooth loss if left untreated.\n\n## Key Terms\n- Gingivitis: Inflammation of the gums.\n- Periodontal disease: Damage to the tissues and structures supporting the teeth.\n- Plaque: Sticky film that forms on the teeth and contains bacteria.\n- Tartar: Hardened plaque that adheres to the teeth.\n- Dental prophylaxis: Professional teeth cleaning performed by a veterinarian.\n\n## Detailed Explanation\nCatMed-GingivitisAndPeriodontalDisease occurs when plaque and tartar accumulate on the teeth, leading to bacterial overgrowth and inflammation of the gums. The bacteria release toxins that damage the gum tissue and cause the body's immune system to respond with inflammation.\n\nIf left untreated, gingivitis can progress to periodontal disease. In periodontal disease, the inflammation extends beyond the gums and affects the supporting structures of the teeth, including the periodontal ligament and the alveolar bone. This can result in tooth mobility, tooth loss, and even bone infection.\n\n## Concepts\n- Gingivitis and periodontal disease are common dental conditions in cats.\n- Plaque and tartar accumulation leads to bacterial overgrowth and inflammation.\n- Untreated gingivitis can progress to periodontal disease, causing tooth loss and bone infection.\n\n## Examples\n- Example 1: A cat with gingivitis may have red, swollen gums and bad breath.\n- Example 2: A cat with advanced periodontal disease may have loose teeth and difficulty eating.\n\n## Tips for Understanding\n- Regular dental care, including brushing your cat's teeth, can help prevent gingivitis and periodontal disease.\n- Dental prophylaxis performed by a veterinarian is necessary to remove plaque and tartar.\n- Look out for signs of dental disease in your cat, such as bad breath, drooling, and reluctance to eat.\n\n## Questions and Answers\n1. Q: Can gingivitis in cats be reversed?\n   A: Yes, gingivitis can be reversed with proper dental care, including professional teeth cleaning and regular brushing.\n\n2. Q: Is periodontal disease common in cats?\n   A: Yes, periodontal disease is a common dental condition in cats, affecting a significant number of adult cats.\n\n## Facts\n- Cats are prone to dental disease due to their dental anatomy and the buildup of plaque and tartar.\n- Dental disease can lead to other health problems, such as kidney disease and heart disease.\n- Regular dental check-ups and cleanings are essential for maintaining your cat's oral health.\n\n## Summary Points\n- CatMed-GingivitisAndPeriodontalDisease is characterized by inflammation of the gums and damage to the supporting structures of the teeth.\n- Plaque and tartar accumulation lead to bacterial overgrowth and inflammation.\n- Regular dental care and professional teeth cleaning are crucial for preventing and treating gingivitis and periodontal disease in cats."
