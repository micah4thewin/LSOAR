  "article": "## Introduction\n\nThis documentation provides step-by-step instructions for basic network troubleshooting on Arch Linux. It covers common issues, troubleshooting techniques, and best practices for resolving network-related problems.\n\n## Objective and Scope\n\nThe objective of this documentation is to help users diagnose and fix network issues on Arch Linux. It focuses on troubleshooting common problems like connectivity issues, DNS resolution problems, and network configuration errors.\n\nThe scope of this documentation includes:\n\n- Basic network troubleshooting techniques\n- Troubleshooting network connectivity issues\n- Troubleshooting DNS resolution problems\n- Troubleshooting network configuration errors\n\n## Requirements and Pre-requisites\n\nTo follow the instructions in this documentation, you will need:\n\n- A computer running Arch Linux\n- Root access or sudo privileges\n- Basic knowledge of the Linux command line\n\n## Step-by-Step Instructions\n\n1. **Check network connectivity**: Start by checking if your computer has a working network connection. You can do this by pinging a well-known website like google.com. Open a terminal and run the following command:\n\n   ```bash\n   ping -c 5 google.com\n   ```\n\n   If you receive replies from google.com, it means your network connection is working. If not, move on to the next step.\n\n2. **Check network interface status**: Use the `ip` command to check the status of your network interfaces. Open a terminal and run the following command:\n\n   ```bash\n   ip link show\n   ```\n\n   This will display a list of network interfaces on your system. Make sure the desired interface is up and has an IP address assigned to it. If not, you may need to configure the interface or check the physical connection.\n\n3. **Check DNS resolution**: If you are experiencing DNS resolution problems, you can use the `nslookup` command to troubleshoot. Open a terminal and run the following command:\n\n   ```bash\n   nslookup google.com\n   ```\n\n   This will display the IP address associated with the domain name. If the command fails or returns incorrect results, you may need to check your DNS configuration or try using a different DNS server.\n\n4. **Check network configuration**: If all else fails, you may need to check your network configuration files. The main configuration file for network interfaces is located at `/etc/netctl`. Open the file using a text editor and verify that the settings are correct. You may also need to check other configuration files like `/etc/resolv.conf` for DNS settings.\n\n## Code Snippets and Commands\n\n- `ping -c 5 google.com`: Sends ICMP echo requests to google.com and waits for replies. Useful for checking network connectivity.\n- `ip link show`: Displays the status of network interfaces. Helpful for checking if an interface is up and has an IP address assigned.\n- `nslookup google.com`: Performs a DNS lookup for the domain name google.com. Useful for troubleshooting DNS resolution problems.\n\n## Troubleshooting and Common Issues\n\n- **No network connectivity**: If you are unable to ping any external websites, check your network cable or Wi-Fi connection. You may also need to restart your router or contact your ISP.\n- **DNS resolution problems**: If you are unable to resolve domain names, check your DNS configuration. You can try using a different DNS server like Google DNS (8.8.8.8) or Cloudflare DNS (1.1.1.1).\n- **Network interface not found**: If the `ip link show` command does not display the desired interface, it may not be recognized by the system. Check if the interface is properly connected and supported by your hardware and kernel.\n- **Incorrect network configuration**: If your network configuration files are incorrect, you may experience various network issues. Double-check the settings in `/etc/netctl` and other relevant configuration files.\n\n## Best Practices and Recommendations\n\n- Keep your system and network software up to date to ensure security and stability.\n- Use strong and unique passwords for your network connections to prevent unauthorized access.\n- Regularly check your network logs for any suspicious activity or errors.\n- Enable a firewall to protect your system from unauthorized network traffic.\n- Backup your network configuration files to easily restore them in case of issues.\n\n## Summary and Conclusion\n\nThis documentation provided step-by-step instructions for basic network troubleshooting on Arch Linux. It covered common issues, troubleshooting techniques, and best practices for resolving network-related problems. By following these instructions and utilizing the recommended practices, users can effectively diagnose and fix network issues on their Arch Linux systems."
