It should be highlighted in the copy to attract attention.\n- **Call to action (CTA)**: A CTA is a statement that prompts the audience to take a specific action, such as making a purchase, subscribing, or signing up for a newsletter.\n- **Emotional appeal**: Copywriting often utilizes emotional appeal to connect with the audience on a deeper level. It can be achieved by using storytelling, evoking emotions, or addressing pain points.\n- **Benefits vs. features**: Copy should focus on the benefits of a product or service rather than just listing its features. The audience wants to know how it will improve their lives.\n\n## Strategies\n- **Research**: Thorough research is crucial for effective copywriting. It involves understanding the target audience, competitors, and market trends.\n- **Compelling headlines**: Attention-grabbing headlines are essential to capture the audience's attention.

A/B testing, analyzing metrics, and gathering feedback can help identify areas for improvement.\n\n## Case Studies\n- **Nike's \"Just Do It\"**: Nike's iconic slogan is a perfect example of effective copywriting.
