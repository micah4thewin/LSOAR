The marketing mix includes the four Ps: product, price, place, and promotion.\n\n## Strategies\nThere are various strategies and techniques that businesses can employ to develop their marketing strategy. Some common strategies include:\n\n1. Segmentation and targeting: Dividing the market into distinct groups based on characteristics such as demographics, psychographics, or behavior, and targeting specific segments with tailored marketing messages.\n\n2.
