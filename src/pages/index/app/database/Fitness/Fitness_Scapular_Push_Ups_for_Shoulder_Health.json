Pause briefly in the protracted position and then retract (squeeze together) your shoulder blades as you push back up to the starting position.\n5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.\n\nRemember to maintain proper form throughout the exercise. Avoid sagging or arching your lower back and keep your core engaged for stability.\n\n## Benefits\nFitness Scapular Push-Ups offer several benefits:\n- Improved shoulder stability: By targeting the scapular muscles, this exercise enhances the stability of the shoulder joint, reducing the risk of injuries.\n- Increased shoulder strength: The controlled movement of the scapulae during Fitness Scapular Push-Ups helps strengthen the muscles surrounding the shoulder joint.\n- Enhanced posture: Regularly performing this exercise can improve your posture by promoting proper alignment of the shoulders and upper back.\n- Injury prevention: Strong scapular muscles contribute to better shoulder mechanics, reducing the likelihood of overuse injuries and imbalances.\n\n## Muscles Targeted\nFitness Scapular Push-Ups primarily target the following muscles:\n- Rhomboids\n- Trapezius\n- Serratus anterior\n- Deltoids\n- Pectoralis minor\n\nBy engaging and strengthening these muscles, you can improve your overall shoulder stability and function.\n\n## Common Mistakes\nAvoid these common mistakes when performing Fitness Scapular Push-Ups:\n1.
