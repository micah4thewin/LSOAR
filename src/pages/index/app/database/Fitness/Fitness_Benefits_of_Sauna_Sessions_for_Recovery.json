Relax: Sit or lie down comfortably in the sauna room, allowing the heat to penetrate your muscles and promote relaxation.\n\n## Benefits\nSauna sessions for recovery offer a wide range of benefits, including:\n- Improved Circulation: The heat from the sauna causes blood vessels to dilate, increasing blood flow to muscles and promoting nutrient delivery and waste removal.\n- Muscle Relaxation: The warmth of the sauna helps to relax tense muscles, reducing muscle soreness and stiffness.\n- Detoxification: Sweating during a sauna session helps eliminate toxins from the body, enhancing overall well-being.\n- Stress Relief: Sauna sessions promote relaxation and release endorphins, which can reduce stress and improve mood.\n- Enhanced Recovery: The increased blood flow and muscle relaxation provided by sauna sessions can speed up the recovery process after intense workouts.\n\n## Muscles Targeted\nWhile sauna sessions primarily focus on overall recovery, they indirectly benefit all muscle groups by promoting relaxation and improved circulation throughout the body.\n\n## Common Mistakes\nTo avoid potential risks and maximize the benefits of sauna sessions for recovery, be mindful of the following common mistakes:\n1.
