Returning to intense training too soon: Rushing back into intense training without proper recovery can lead to overtraining and increased risk of injury.\n\n## Variations and Progressions\nRecovery post-marathon does not involve specific variations or progressions. However, as you recover, you can gradually increase the intensity and duration of your low-impact activities to rebuild strength and endurance.\n\n## Equipment and Setup\nNo specific equipment or setup is required for recovery post-marathon. However, having comfortable shoes and appropriate clothing for low-impact activities can enhance your recovery experience.\n\n## Safety Precautions\nWhile recovery post-marathon is generally safe, it is important to listen to your body and not push through excessive pain or discomfort.
