  "article": "## NodeJS Server-Sent Events\n\n### Introduction\nNodeJS Server-Sent Events (SSE) is a technology that allows a server to send real-time updates to clients over a single HTTP connection. It is a simple and efficient way to push data from the server to the client without the need for continuous polling or long-polling techniques.\n\n### Objective and Scope\nThe objective of this documentation is to provide a step-by-step guide on how to implement Server-Sent Events in a NodeJS application. It will cover the necessary requirements, pre-requisites, and best practices for setting up and using SSE.\n\n### Requirements and Pre-requisites\nBefore proceeding with implementing Server-Sent Events in NodeJS, ensure that you have the following:\n\n- NodeJS installed on your machine\n- Basic knowledge of JavaScript and NodeJS\n- A text editor or IDE for writing code\n\n### Step-by-Step Instructions\n1. Create a new NodeJS project or navigate to an existing project directory.\n2. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.\n3. Install the `express` package by running the following command:\n   ```\n   npm install express\n   ```\n4. Create a new JavaScript file, e.g., `server.js`, and open it in your text editor.\n5. Import the necessary modules at the top of the file:\n   ```javascript\n   const express = require('express');\n   const app = express();\n   ```\n6. Define a route for handling the SSE connection:\n   ```javascript\n   app.get('/sse', (req, res) => {\n     res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/event-stream');\n     res.setHeader('Cache-Control', 'no-cache');\n     res.setHeader('Connection', 'keep-alive');\n     res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*');\n     \n     // SSE logic goes here\n   });\n   ```\n7. Implement the SSE logic within the route:\n   ```javascript\n   setInterval(() => {\n     const data = new Date().toLocaleTimeString();\n     res.write(`data: ${data}\\n\\n`);\n   }, 1000);\n   ```\n8. Start the server by adding the following code at the end of the file:\n   ```javascript\n   app.listen(3000, () => {\n     console.log('Server running on port 3000');\n   });\n   ```\n9. Save the file and exit the text editor.\n10. Run the server by executing the following command in your terminal:\n    ```\n    node server.js\n    ```\n11. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/sse`.\n12. You should now see the real-time updates being displayed in the browser console.\n\n### Code Snippets and Commands\n- Install the `express` package:\n  ```\n  npm install express\n  ```\n\n- Start the server:\n  ```\n  node server.js\n  ```\n\n### Troubleshooting and Common Issues\n- If you are not seeing the real-time updates in the browser console, make sure you have correctly implemented the SSE logic in your server code.\n- Check for any errors or warnings in the terminal or browser console.\n\n### Best Practices and Recommendations\n- Keep the SSE logic within a separate route to maintain code organization.\n- Use appropriate headers to ensure proper SSE functionality.\n- Handle errors and close the SSE connection when necessary.\n\n### Summary and Conclusion\nIn this documentation, we have covered the basics of implementing Server-Sent Events in a NodeJS application. By following the step-by-step instructions and best practices, you can easily set up real-time updates from the server to the client using SSE. Remember to handle errors and close the SSE connection when needed for optimal performance and security."
