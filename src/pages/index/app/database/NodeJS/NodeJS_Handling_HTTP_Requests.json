We will cover the basics of setting up an HTTP server, handling different types of requests, and processing request data.\n\n### Objective and Scope\nThe objective of this documentation is to provide a step-by-step guide on handling HTTP requests using Node.js. The scope of this documentation is limited to handling HTTP requests and does not cover advanced topics such as authentication or security.\n\n### Requirements and Pre-requisites\nTo follow along with this documentation, you will need the following:\n- Node.js installed on your machine\n- A text editor or IDE of your choice\n\n### Step-by-Step Instructions\n1. Create a new directory for your project.\n2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.\n3. Initialize a new Node.js project by running the command `npm init`.\n4. Install the `http` module by running the command `npm install http`.\n5. Create a new file called `server.js` and open it in your text editor.\n6. Import the `http` module by adding the following line at the top of the file:\n   ```javascript\n   const http = require('http');\n   ```\n7. Create a new HTTP server by calling the `createServer` method of the `http` module:\n   ```javascript\n   const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {\n     // Request handling logic goes here\n   });\n   ```\n8. Start the server by calling the `listen` method and specifying the port number:\n   ```javascript\n   const port = 3000;\n   server.listen(port, () => {\n     console.log(`Server listening on port ${port}`);\n   });\n   ```\n9. Inside the request handler function, you can access the request and response objects to handle the request and send a response. For example, to handle a GET request and send a simple \"Hello, World!\" response, you can add the following code:\n   ```javascript\n   if (req.method === 'GET') {\n     res.statusCode = 200;\n     res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');\n     res.end('Hello, World!');\n   }\n   ```\n10. Save the file and go back to the terminal or command prompt.\n11. Start the server by running the command `node server.js`.\n12. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. You should see the \"Hello, World!\" message.\n\n### Code Snippets and Commands\n- `npm init`: Initializes a new Node.js project.\n- `npm install http`: Installs the `http` module.\n- `const http = require('http')`: Imports the `http` module.\n- `http.createServer()`: Creates a new HTTP server.\n- `server.listen(port, callback)`: Starts the server and listens on the specified port.\n- `res.statusCode = 200`: Sets the status code of the response.\n- `res.setHeader(name, value)`: Sets a response header.\n- `res.end(data)`: Sends the response data and ends the response.\n\n### Troubleshooting and Common Issues\n- If you encounter an error message saying that the `http` module is not found, make sure you have installed it using the `npm install http` command.\n- If the server is not starting or you are unable to access it, check if there are any errors in your code or if the port you specified is already in use.\n\n### Best Practices and Recommendations\n- Use appropriate status codes and headers in your responses to provide meaningful information to the client.\n- Validate and sanitize user input to prevent security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.\n- Implement error handling to gracefully handle unexpected errors and provide helpful error messages to the client.\n\n### Summary and Conclusion\nHandling HTTP requests in Node.js is a fundamental skill for building web applications. By following the steps outlined in this documentation, you should now have a basic understanding of how to set up an HTTP server, handle different types of requests, and send responses. Remember to always follow best practices and recommendations to ensure the security and performance of your applications."
