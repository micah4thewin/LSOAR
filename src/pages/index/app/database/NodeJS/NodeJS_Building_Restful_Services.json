In this documentation, we will focus on building RESTful services using Node.js. RESTful services are a way of designing and implementing web services that adhere to the principles of the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style.\n\n### Objective and Scope\nThe objective of this documentation is to provide step-by-step instructions on how to build RESTful services using Node.js. The scope of this documentation will cover the basic concepts of RESTful services, setting up a Node.js project, implementing CRUD operations, and handling authentication and authorization.\n\n### Requirements and Pre-requisites\nBefore starting with the instructions, make sure you have the following requirements and pre-requisites in place:\n\n- Node.js installed on your system\n- Basic knowledge of JavaScript and web development concepts\n- A text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for writing code\n\n### Step-by-Step Instructions\n1. Setting up a Node.js project\n   - Create a new directory for your project\n   - Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory\n   - Run the command `npm init` to initialize a new Node.js project\n   - Follow the prompts to provide details about your project\n\n2. Installing required dependencies\n   - In your project directory, run the command `npm install express` to install the Express framework\n   - Run the command `npm install body-parser` to install the body-parser middleware for parsing request bodies\n   - Run the command `npm install mongoose` to install the Mongoose library for interacting with MongoDB\n\n3. Creating a basic Express server\n   - Create a new file named `server.js` in your project directory\n   - Open `server.js` in your text editor or IDE\n   - Import the required modules and initialize an Express app\n   - Set up the basic server configuration, such as listening on a specific port\n\n4. Implementing CRUD operations\n   - Define the routes for handling different HTTP methods and URLs\n   - Implement the logic for creating, reading, updating, and deleting resources\n   - Use the Mongoose library to interact with a MongoDB database\n\n5. Handling authentication and authorization\n   - Implement a user authentication mechanism, such as JWT (JSON Web Tokens)\n   - Protect the routes that require authentication by validating the JWT\n   - Implement authorization logic to ensure that only authorized users can perform certain actions\n\n### Code Snippets and Commands\nHere are some code snippets and commands that you may find useful while building RESTful services using Node.js:\n\n- Creating a new Express app:\n\n  ```javascript\n  const express = require('express');\n  const app = express();\n  ```\n\n- Defining a route that handles a GET request:\n\n  ```javascript\n  app.get('/api/resource', (req, res) => {\n    // Logic for handling the GET request\n  });\n  ```\n\n- Installing a Node.js package using npm:\n\n  ```bash\n  npm install package-name\n  ```\n\n### Troubleshooting and Common Issues\n- If you encounter any issues while installing or running the dependencies, make sure you have Node.js installed correctly and that you have the necessary permissions to install packages globally.\n- If you are facing issues with the MongoDB connection, double-check your connection string and make sure your MongoDB server is running.\n\n### Best Practices and Recommendations\n- Follow the principles of RESTful design when designing your API endpoints.\n- Use proper error handling and return appropriate HTTP status codes in your responses.\n- Implement input validation and sanitize user input to prevent security vulnerabilities.\n- Use a version control system, such as Git, to track changes in your codebase.\n\n### Summary and Conclusion\nIn this documentation, we have covered the basics of building RESTful services using Node.js. We have discussed setting up a Node.js project, installing dependencies, implementing CRUD operations, and handling authentication and authorization. By following these instructions and best practices, you can build scalable and efficient RESTful services using Node.js."
