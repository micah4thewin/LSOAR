This documentation will guide you through the usage of the Stream API to process and manipulate large data sets in NodeJS.\n\n### Objective and Scope\nThe objective of this documentation is to provide a comprehensive guide on using the NodeJS Stream API for handling large data. It covers the basic concepts, requirements, step-by-step instructions, code snippets, troubleshooting, best practices, and recommendations.\n\n### Requirements and Pre-requisites\nTo follow this documentation, you need the following requirements and pre-requisites:\n- NodeJS installed on your system\n- Basic knowledge of JavaScript and NodeJS\n\n### Step-by-Step Instructions\n1. Install the required NodeJS modules:\n   ```bash\n   npm install fs\n   npm install stream\n   ```\n\n2. Import the necessary modules in your NodeJS script:\n   ```javascript\n   const fs = require('fs');\n   const { Readable, Writable, Transform } = require('stream');\n   ```\n\n3. Create a Readable stream to read the large data file:\n   ```javascript\n   const readableStream = fs.createReadStream('large_data.txt');\n   ```\n\n4. Create a Writable stream to write the processed data:\n   ```javascript\n   const writableStream = fs.createWriteStream('processed_data.txt');\n   ```\n\n5. Create a Transform stream to process the data:\n   ```javascript\n   const transformStream = new Transform({\n     transform(chunk, encoding, callback) {\n       // Process the chunk of data\n       const processedData = processData(chunk);\n       \n       // Pass the processed data to the writable stream\n       this.push(processedData);\n       callback();\n     }\n   });\n   ```\n\n6. Pipe the readable stream to the transform stream to process the data:\n   ```javascript\n   readableStream.pipe(transformStream);\n   ```\n\n7. Pipe the transform stream to the writable stream to write the processed data:\n   ```javascript\n   transformStream.pipe(writableStream);\n   ```\n\n8. Listen for the 'finish' event to know when the processing is complete:\n   ```javascript\n   writableStream.on('finish', () => {\n     console.log('Data processing completed.');\n   });\n   ```\n\n### Code Snippets and Commands\n- Install required modules:\n  ```bash\n  npm install fs\n  npm install stream\n  ```\n\n- Import modules:\n  ```javascript\n  const fs = require('fs');\n  const { Readable, Writable, Transform } = require('stream');\n  ```\n\n- Create a Readable stream:\n  ```javascript\n  const readableStream = fs.createReadStream('large_data.txt');\n  ```\n\n- Create a Writable stream:\n  ```javascript\n  const writableStream = fs.createWriteStream('processed_data.txt');\n  ```\n\n- Create a Transform stream:\n  ```javascript\n  const transformStream = new Transform({\n    transform(chunk, encoding, callback) {\n      // Process the chunk of data\n      const processedData = processData(chunk);\n      \n      // Pass the processed data to the writable stream\n      this.push(processedData);\n      callback();\n    }\n  });\n  ```\n\n- Pipe streams:\n  ```javascript\n  readableStream.pipe(transformStream);\n  transformStream.pipe(writableStream);\n  ```\n\n### Troubleshooting and Common Issues\n- Ensure that the input file exists and has the correct permissions.\n- Check if the output file already exists and if you have write permissions.\n- Make sure the file paths are correct in the code.\n- Verify that the processData function is correctly implemented.\n\n### Best Practices and Recommendations\n- Use streams for handling large data to avoid memory issues.\n- Break down the processing logic into smaller chunks for better performance.\n- Implement error handling and handle stream events appropriately.\n- Test the code with smaller data sets before processing large data.\n\n### Summary and Conclusion\nThe NodeJS Stream API is a powerful tool for handling large data efficiently. By using streams, you can process and manipulate large data sets without consuming excessive memory. This documentation provided an overview of the Stream API, requirements, step-by-step instructions, code snippets, troubleshooting tips, and best practices. With this knowledge, you can confidently work with large data in NodeJS."
