One of the common use cases of Node.js is creating web servers. In this documentation, we will explore how to create a simple web server using Node.js.\n\n## Objective and Scope\nThe objective of this documentation is to provide step-by-step instructions on creating a web server using Node.js. The scope of this documentation covers the basic setup and configuration required to run a web server locally.\n\n## Requirements and Pre-requisites\nBefore proceeding with the instructions, make sure you have the following requirements and pre-requisites in place:\n- Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from the official website: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)\n- A text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for writing code.\n\n## Step-by-Step Instructions\n1. Create a new directory for your project.\n2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.\n3. Initialize a new Node.js project by running the following command:\n   ```\n   npm init -y\n   ```\n4. Install the `http` module by running the following command:\n   ```\n   npm install http\n   ```\n5. Create a new JavaScript file, e.g., `server.js`, and open it in your text editor.\n6. Import the `http` module and create a server instance:\n   ```javascript\n   const http = require('http');\n   \n   const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {\n     res.statusCode = 200;\n     res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');\n     res.end('Hello, World!');\n   });\n   ```\n7. Start the server by listening on a specific port:\n   ```javascript\n   const port = 3000;\n   \n   server.listen(port, () => {\n     console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${port}/`);\n   });\n   ```\n8. Save the file and exit the text editor.\n9. Run the server by executing the following command in the terminal:\n   ```\n   node server.js\n   ```\n10. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`. You should see the message \"Hello, World!\" displayed on the page.\n\n## Code Snippets and Commands\n- `npm init -y`: Initializes a new Node.js project with default settings.\n- `npm install http`: Installs the `http` module.\n- `const http = require('http')`: Imports the `http` module.\n- `http.createServer((req, res) => { ... })`: Creates a server instance.\n- `res.statusCode = 200`: Sets the HTTP status code to 200 (OK).\n- `res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain')`: Sets the content type to plain text.\n- `res.end('Hello, World!')`: Sends the response with the message \"Hello, World!\".\n- `server.listen(port, () => { ... })`: Starts the server and listens on the specified port.\n\n## Troubleshooting and Common Issues\n- If you encounter an error message like \"node: command not found\", make sure Node.js is properly installed and the executable is in your system's PATH.\n- If the server is not running or you cannot access it, check if there are any errors in your code or if the specified port is already in use.\n\n## Best Practices and Recommendations\n- Use a version control system (e.g., Git) to track changes in your codebase.\n- Implement error handling and logging in your server code to improve reliability and debug issues.\n- Consider using a framework like Express.js to simplify the process of building web servers and handling HTTP requests.\n\n## Summary and Conclusion\nCreating a web server using Node.js is a straightforward process. By following the step-by-step instructions provided in this documentation, you should be able to set up a basic web server and start serving content. Remember to adhere to best practices and recommendations to ensure optimal performance and security in your server applications."
