It requires individuals to be proactive, organized, and self-disciplined. Effective time management involves setting goals, breaking them down into actionable steps, and allocating time for each task accordingly.\n\n## Essential Techniques\n1. **Goal Setting**: Start by setting clear and achievable goals.
