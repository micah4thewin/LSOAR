It marked a turning point in history, as it challenged the traditional monarchy and aristocracy, leading to the rise of democratic ideals and the birth of modern politics. The French Revolution has had a profound impact on subsequent revolutions and the development of democratic principles around the world.\n\n## Historical Background\nThe French Revolution was fueled by a combination of social, economic, and political factors. France was deeply divided into three estates: the clergy, the nobility, and the commoners. The commoners, who made up the majority of the population, faced heavy taxation and limited political representation. Additionally, the Enlightenment ideas of liberty, equality, and popular sovereignty had gained popularity among the educated elite, further fueling discontent.\n\nThe revolution began on July 14, 1789, with the storming of the Bastille, a symbol of royal authority. This event marked the start of a series of uprisings and protests across France.\n\n## Key Figures and Events\n- Maximilien Robespierre: A prominent figure in the French Revolution, Robespierre was a leader of the radical Jacobin faction. He played a key role in the Reign of Terror, a period of mass executions.\n- Marie Antoinette: The queen of France and wife of King Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette became a symbol of the excesses and corruption of the monarchy.\n- The Tennis Court Oath: On June 20, 1789, members of the Third Estate took an oath not to disband until a new constitution was established.\n- The Reign of Terror: From 1793 to 1794, the Committee of Public Safety, led by Robespierre, executed thousands of people deemed enemies of the revolution.\n\n> \"Liberty, equality, fraternity!\" - Slogan of the French Revolution\n\n## Major Impacts and Changes\nThe French Revolution had far-reaching consequences, both in France and globally.

Additionally, newspapers and official documents from the time provide valuable insights into the events and sentiments of the period.\n\nHistorians have analyzed these sources to gain a deeper understanding of the revolution. However, interpretations of the French Revolution have varied over time, with different historians emphasizing different causes and consequences.\n\n## Contemporary Relevance\nThe French Revolution continues to have contemporary relevance.
