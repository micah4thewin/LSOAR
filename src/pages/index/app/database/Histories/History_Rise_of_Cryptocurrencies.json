Studying the French Revolution allows us to understand the complexities of revolutionary movements, the consequences of social inequality, and the struggle for individual rights and liberties.\n\n## Historical Background\nThe French Revolution took place in a time of political and social unrest. France was an absolute monarchy ruled by King Louis XVI, and the country was burdened with a rigid social structure, economic inequality, and widespread poverty.

It demonstrated the dangers of unchecked power and ideological extremism.\n\n- Spread of Revolutionary Ideas: The French Revolution inspired other revolutionary movements across Europe and the Americas, contributing to the spread of democratic ideals and the fight against tyranny.\n\n## Historical Sources and Evidence\nPrimary sources from the French Revolution include speeches, pamphlets, and official documents, such as the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen.
