Understanding the French Revolution is crucial for comprehending the development of modern democracy and the struggle for individual rights.\n\n## Historical Background\nThe French Revolution took place in the late 18th century, following a series of economic crises, political unrest, and social inequality in France.

Some key figures include:\n\n- Maximilien Robespierre: A prominent leader of the revolution, Robespierre advocated for radical political and social change. His role in the Reign of Terror, a period of mass executions, remains controversial.\n> \"The Revolution is like Saturn, it devours its own children.\" - Maximilien Robespierre\n\n- Marie Antoinette: The Queen of France and wife of King Louis XVI.
