It represents one of the most significant events in world history, as it marked the transition from an absolute monarchy to a republic and laid the foundation for modern democratic principles.

France in the late 18th century was characterized by a rigid social hierarchy, with the clergy and nobility enjoying privileges while the majority of the population suffered from poverty and inequality. Additionally, the monarchy, under the rule of King Louis XVI, faced mounting financial difficulties due to wars and extravagant spending.\n\nThe revolution began on July 14, 1789, with the storming of the Bastille, a symbol of royal authority. This event marked the start of a period of intense political and social turmoil in France.\n\n## Key Figures and Events\n- Maximilien Robespierre: A prominent figure in the revolution, Robespierre was a leader of the radical Jacobin Club and played a key role in the Reign of Terror.\n- Marie Antoinette: The queen of France at the time, Marie Antoinette became a symbol of the monarchy's excesses and was eventually executed.\n- The Reign of Terror: From 1793 to 1794, the Committee of Public Safety, led by Robespierre, unleashed a wave of violence and repression, resulting in the execution of thousands of perceived enemies of the revolution.\n- The Execution of Louis XVI: In 1793, King Louis XVI was tried and executed by guillotine, symbolizing the end of the monarchy.\n\n> \"Let them eat cake.\" - Marie Antoinette\n\n## Major Impacts and Changes\nThe French Revolution had far-reaching consequences that reshaped French society and influenced the world.
