It marked the end of the Bourbon monarchy and the rise of a new era of Enlightenment ideals, nationalism, and revolutionary fervor. The French Revolution had a profound impact not only on France but also on the rest of Europe and the world. Understanding this pivotal event is crucial for comprehending the development of modern political systems, the struggle for human rights, and the concept of popular sovereignty.\n\n## Historical Background\nThe French Revolution was fueled by a combination of political, social, and economic factors. France was burdened by a rigid social structure, an oppressive monarchy, and a growing financial crisis due to years of extravagant spending and costly wars. The Enlightenment ideas of philosophers such as Rousseau and Voltaire, which emphasized individual liberty, equality, and the rights of man, also played a significant role in shaping the revolutionary spirit.\n\nThe revolution began on July 14, 1789, with the storming of the Bastille, a symbol of royal authority. This event marked the start of a series of revolutionary actions and the establishment of a new political order in France.\n\n## Key Figures and Events\n- Maximilien Robespierre: A prominent figure in the French Revolution, Robespierre was a leader of the radical Jacobin faction and played a key role in the Reign of Terror.\n- Louis XVI: The last Bourbon king of France, Louis XVI's reign was marked by financial crisis and political unrest.
