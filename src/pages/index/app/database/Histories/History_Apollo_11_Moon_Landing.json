The majority of the population, known as the Third Estate, faced heavy taxation and limited political representation.\n\nThe revolution was triggered by a combination of factors, including financial crisis, food shortages, and the influence of Enlightenment ideas. On May 5, 1789, the Estates-General, a representative body composed of delegates from the three estates, was convened to address these issues.\n\n## Key Figures and Events\n- Maximilien Robespierre: A key figure in the French Revolution, Robespierre was a leading member of the Committee of Public Safety and played a significant role in the Reign of Terror.\n- The Storming of the Bastille (July 14, 1789): This event marked the beginning of the revolution and symbolized the overthrow of the monarchy.

Robespierre and the Committee of Public Safety implemented radical policies to suppress counter-revolutionary activities.\n- The Rise of Napoleon Bonaparte: The French Revolution ultimately led to the rise of Napoleon Bonaparte, who seized power in a coup d'Ã©tat in 1799 and became Emperor of the French in 1804.\n\n> \"Liberty, Equality, Fraternity\" - Motto of the French Revolution\n\n## Major Impacts and Changes\nThe French Revolution had profound impacts on France and the world:\n- End of the Monarchy: The revolution resulted in the abolition of the monarchy and the establishment of a republic.\n- Rise of Nationalism: The revolution fostered a sense of national identity and inspired other nations to strive for independence and self-governance.\n- Spread of Revolutionary Ideas: The French Revolution spread revolutionary ideals such as equality, democracy, and human rights across Europe and beyond.\n- Social and Political Reforms: The revolution brought about significant social and political reforms, including the abolition of feudalism, the Napoleonic Code, and the creation of a more egalitarian society.\n\n## Historical Sources and Evidence\nHistorians study the French Revolution through a range of primary and secondary sources.
