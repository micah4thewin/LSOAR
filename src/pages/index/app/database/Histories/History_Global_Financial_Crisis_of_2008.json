It marked the end of the Bourbon monarchy and the rise of the French Republic. The French Revolution is considered one of the most important events in world history as it brought significant changes to France and had a profound impact on the development of modern democracy.\n\n## Historical Background\nThe French Revolution was fueled by a variety of factors, including economic inequality, political corruption, and the influence of Enlightenment ideas. France at the time was an absolute monarchy, with King Louis XVI and his wife, Marie Antoinette, holding significant power. The country was also burdened by a heavy debt and a rigid social structure that favored the nobility and clergy while oppressing the peasantry.\n\nThe revolution began in 1789 when the Third Estate, representing the common people, declared itself the National Assembly and demanded political reform. The storming of the Bastille on July 14, 1789, marked a symbolic turning point and is often seen as the start of the revolution.\n\n## Key Figures and Events\n- Maximilien Robespierre: A prominent figure in the revolution, Robespierre was a key leader of the radical Jacobin faction. He played a central role in the Reign of Terror, a period of intense political repression.\n- The Reign of Terror: From 1793 to 1794, the Committee of Public Safety, led by Robespierre, executed thousands of suspected counter-revolutionaries, resulting in a climate of fear and suspicion.\n- The Execution of Louis XVI: In 1793, King Louis XVI was tried and convicted of treason. He was executed by guillotine, signaling the end of the monarchy and the beginning of a new era.\n\n> \"Liberty, equality, fraternity!\" - Slogan of the French Revolution\n\n## Major Impacts and Changes\nThe French Revolution had far-reaching consequences that transformed France and influenced the world.
