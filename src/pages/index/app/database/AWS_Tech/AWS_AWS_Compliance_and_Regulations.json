AWS has obtained HIPAA compliance certification, allowing healthcare organizations to store and process protected health information (PHI) on AWS.\n\n```javascript\nconst AWS = require('aws-sdk');\nconst s3 = new AWS.S3();\n\n// Create a new bucket with HIPAA compliance enabled\nconst params = {\n  Bucket: 'my-hipaa-bucket',\n  CreateBucketConfiguration: {\n    LocationConstraint: 'us-east-1'\n  },\n  ObjectLockEnabledForBucket: true,\n  ObjectLockConfiguration: {\n    ObjectLockEnabled: 'Enabled',\n    Rule: {\n      DefaultRetention: {\n        Mode: 'GOVERNANCE',\n        Days: 30\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  BucketKeyEnabled: true\n};\n\ns3.createBucket(params, (err, data) => {\n  if (err) {\n    console.error(err);\n  } else {\n    console.log(data);\n  }\n});\n```\n\n### Example 2: PCI DSS Compliance\nPCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) is a set of security standards for organizations that handle credit card information. AWS has obtained PCI DSS compliance certification, allowing organizations to securely process, store, and transmit credit card data on AWS.\n\n```javascript\nconst AWS = require('aws-sdk');\nconst dynamodb = new AWS.DynamoDB();\n\n// Create a new DynamoDB table with PCI DSS compliance enabled\nconst params = {\n  TableName: 'my-pci-table',\n  KeySchema: [\n    { AttributeName: 'id', KeyType: 'HASH' }\n  ],\n  AttributeDefinitions: [\n    { AttributeName: 'id', AttributeType: 'N' }\n  ],\n  ProvisionedThroughput: {\n    ReadCapacityUnits: 5,\n    WriteCapacityUnits: 5\n  },\n  SSESpecification: {\n    Enabled: true,\n    KMSMasterKeyId: 'arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:123456789012:key/abcd1234-5678-90ab-cdef-1234567890ab'\n  }\n};\n\ndynamodb.createTable(params, (err, data) => {\n  if (err) {\n    console.error(err);\n  } else {\n    console.log(data);\n  }\n});\n```\n\n## Tips for Understanding\n- Familiarize yourself with the specific compliance requirements of your industry or geography.\n- Understand the shared responsibility model and the areas for which you are responsible.\n- Stay up-to-date with the latest compliance certifications and accreditations offered by AWS.\n\n## Questions and Answers\n**Q: What is the shared responsibility model in AWS?**\nA: The shared responsibility model in AWS defines the division of security responsibilities between AWS and the customer.
