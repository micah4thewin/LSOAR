DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service provided by AWS. It offers fast and predictable performance, seamless scalability, and automatic data replication across multiple availability zones.\n\n## Key Terms\n- DynamoDB: A fully managed NoSQL database service provided by AWS.\n- Table: A collection of items in DynamoDB, similar to a table in a traditional relational database.\n- Item: A single data record within a DynamoDB table.\n- Primary Key: A unique identifier for each item in a DynamoDB table.\n\n## Detailed Explanation\nWhen setting up DynamoDB tables in AWS, there are several important steps to follow. First, you need to define the table's schema, which includes specifying the primary key. The primary key can be either a simple primary key or a composite primary key.\n\nA simple primary key consists of a single attribute known as the partition key. This key uniquely identifies each item in the table. On the other hand, a composite primary key consists of both a partition key and a sort key. The combination of the partition key and sort key must be unique for each item.\n\nAfter defining the schema, you can provision the table's throughput capacity. DynamoDB allows you to specify the desired read and write capacity units. Read capacity units determine the number of strongly consistent reads per second, while write capacity units determine the number of writes per second.\n\nOnce the table is provisioned, you can start adding items to it. Each item is represented as a JSON object and must contain the attributes defined in the table's schema. You can use the AWS SDK or API to interact with the table and perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).\n\n## Concepts\n- DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service provided by AWS.\n- Tables in DynamoDB are collections of items.\n- Each item in a DynamoDB table has a unique primary key.\n- Provisioned throughput capacity determines the read and write capacity units for a table.\n\n## Examples\nLet's consider an example of setting up a DynamoDB table for an e-commerce website. The table will store information about products, including their unique identifier (product ID), name, price, and quantity.\n\n```javascript\nconst AWS = require('aws-sdk');\n\nAWS.config.update({ region: 'us-west-2' });\n\nconst dynamodb = new AWS.DynamoDB();\n\nconst params = {\n  TableName: 'Products',\n  KeySchema: [\n    { AttributeName: 'productId', KeyType: 'HASH' },\n  ],\n  AttributeDefinitions: [\n    { AttributeName: 'productId', AttributeType: 'N' },\n    { AttributeName: 'name', AttributeType: 'S' },\n  ],\n  ProvisionedThroughput: {\n    ReadCapacityUnits: 5,\n    WriteCapacityUnits: 5,\n  },\n};\n\ndynamodb.createTable(params, (err, data) => {\n  if (err) {\n    console.error('Error creating table:', err);\n  } else {\n    console.log('Table created successfully:', data);\n  }\n});\n```\n\nIn this example, we define a table named \"Products\" with a simple primary key consisting of the \"productId\" attribute. We also specify the attribute definitions for the primary key attributes. The provisioned throughput capacity is set to 5 read capacity units and 5 write capacity units.\n\n## Tips for Understanding\n- Familiarize yourself with the concepts of NoSQL databases and their advantages over traditional relational databases.\n- Practice using the AWS SDK or API to interact with DynamoDB tables.\n- Experiment with different table schemas and provisioned throughput capacities to understand their impact on performance.\n\n## Questions and Answers\n1. Q: Can I modify the schema of an existing DynamoDB table?\n   - A: Yes, you can modify the schema of an existing table by adding or removing attributes, changing the primary key, or modifying the provisioned throughput capacity. However, some modifications may require recreating the table.\n\n2. Q: How does DynamoDB ensure high availability and durability of data?\n   - A: DynamoDB automatically replicates data across multiple availability zones within a region to ensure high availability and durability. It also offers backup and restore capabilities for additional data protection.\n\n## Interactive Elements\n- Quiz: What are the two types of primary keys in DynamoDB?\n- Thought Exercise: Design a DynamoDB table to store user profiles, including their unique username, email address, and date of birth.\n\n## Summary Points\n- DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service provided by AWS.\n- Tables in DynamoDB consist of items, each with a unique primary key.\n- Provisioned throughput capacity determines the read and write capacity units for a table.\n- DynamoDB offers high availability, durability, and automatic data replication.\n- Modifying the schema of an existing table may require recreating the table."
