They act as virtual firewalls, allowing you to define rules and policies that govern network traffic within your VPC.\n\n## Key Terms\n- VPC: Amazon Virtual Private Cloud, a virtual network dedicated to your AWS account.\n- Security Group: A set of inbound and outbound rules that control traffic for an EC2 instance.\n- Network Access Control List (NACL): An optional layer of security that acts as a firewall for subnets within a VPC.\n\n## Detailed Explanation\nAWS VPC Security Groups and NACLs provide different levels of network security within your VPC. Security Groups operate at the instance level, controlling inbound and outbound traffic based on rules defined for each EC2 instance. NACLs, on the other hand, operate at the subnet level and control traffic at a broader level, affecting all instances within a subnet.\n\nSecurity Groups are stateful, meaning that if an inbound rule allows traffic, the corresponding outbound rule automatically allows the response traffic. They evaluate traffic based on protocols, ports, and IP addresses. By default, all inbound traffic is denied, and you must explicitly allow the traffic you want.\n\nNACLs are stateless, which means that you must define both inbound and outbound rules separately. They evaluate traffic based on rules defined for each subnet. By default, all inbound and outbound traffic is denied, and you must explicitly allow the desired traffic.\n\n## Concepts\n- **Security Group**: Controls traffic at the instance level.\n- **NACL**: Controls traffic at the subnet level.\n- **Stateful**: Security Groups automatically allow response traffic.\n- **Stateless**: NACLs require explicit rules for both inbound and outbound traffic.\n\n## Examples\n1. Example of a Security Group rule allowing SSH access from a specific IP address:\n```javascript\nInbound Rule:\n- Type: SSH\n- Protocol: TCP\n- Port Range: 22\n- Source: 203.0.113.0/24\n```\n\n2. Example of an NACL rule allowing HTTP access from any IP address:\n```javascript\nInbound Rule:\n- Rule Number: 100\n- Protocol: TCP\n- Port Range: 80\n- Source: 0.0.0.0/0\n```\n\n## Tips for Understanding\n- Understand the difference between Security Groups and NACLs: Security Groups operate at the instance level, while NACLs operate at the subnet level.\n- Remember that Security Groups are stateful, meaning they automatically allow response traffic, while NACLs are stateless and require explicit rules for both inbound and outbound traffic.\n\n## Questions and Answers\n1. **Q: Can I associate multiple Security Groups with an EC2 instance?**\n   - A: Yes, you can associate multiple Security Groups with an EC2 instance. The rules from all associated Security Groups are evaluated.\n\n2. **Q: Can I block specific IP addresses using NACLs?**\n   - A: Yes, you can block specific IP addresses by creating explicit deny rules in the NACL configuration.\n\n## Interactive Elements\nNo interactive elements are included in this article.\n\n## Summary Points\n- AWS VPC Security Groups control traffic at the instance level, while NACLs control traffic at the subnet level.\n- Security Groups are stateful, while NACLs are stateless.\n- Security Groups automatically allow response traffic, while NACLs require explicit rules for both inbound and outbound traffic."
