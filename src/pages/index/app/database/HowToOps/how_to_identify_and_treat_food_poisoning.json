Stick to clear liquids such as broth or electrolyte drinks.\n   - Gradually reintroduce bland foods: Once symptoms improve, start introducing bland foods like toast, rice, or boiled potatoes. Avoid spicy, fatty, or dairy-rich foods.\n   - Take over-the-counter medication: If diarrhea is persistent and causing discomfort, consider taking over-the-counter antidiarrheal medication. Follow the dosage instructions carefully.\n   - Apply cold compresses: If you have a fever, use ice packs or cold compresses to reduce body temperature. Avoid direct contact with the skin and limit application to 15 minutes at a time.\n   - Monitor body temperature: Use a thermometer to keep track of your body temperature.
