This guide will provide a step-by-step procedure to build a basic solar water purifier using readily available materials. By harnessing the power of the sun, you can create a simple yet efficient system to purify water in remote areas or during emergencies.\n\n### Materials/Tools\n- Plastic or glass container with lid\n- Clear plastic sheet or glass pane\n- Black paint or black construction paper\n- Rubber bands or adhesive tape\n- Plastic tubing\n- Activated carbon or charcoal\n- Fine sand\n- Gravel or small stones\n- Water source\n- Sunlight\n\n### Step-by-Step Procedure\n1. **Prepare the container**: Clean the container thoroughly to ensure it is free from any contaminants.\n2. **Paint or cover the container**: Apply a coat of black paint to the container or cover it with black construction paper. This will help absorb heat from the sun.\n3. **Create an inlet and outlet**: Using a sharp object, carefully create small holes near the top and bottom of the container. Insert plastic tubing into these holes to serve as the water inlet and outlet.\n4. **Assemble the filtration layers**: Place a layer of fine sand at the bottom of the container, followed by a layer of activated carbon or charcoal, and finally a layer of gravel or small stones. These layers will help filter out impurities from the water.\n5. **Cover the container**: Securely attach a clear plastic sheet or glass pane to the top of the container using rubber bands or adhesive tape. This will create a greenhouse effect and trap solar heat inside.\n6. **Position the solar water purifier**: Place the container in a sunny location where it can receive direct sunlight for several hours a day.\n7. **Fill the container**: Pour water into the container through the inlet tubing. The water will flow through the filtration layers and exit through the outlet tubing.\n8. **Allow solar purification**: Leave the container in the sunlight for several hours to allow the solar heat to evaporate the water and condense it on the inner surface of the cover. The purified water will then drip down into the container.\n9. **Collect purified water**: Regularly check the container and collect the purified water that has accumulated.\n\n### Tips and Considerations\n- Choose a container with a wide opening to facilitate easy filling and cleaning.\n- Ensure the container is placed on a stable surface to prevent any accidents or spillage.\n- Position the solar water purifier in an area with maximum sunlight exposure throughout the day.\n- It is recommended to use activated carbon or charcoal to improve the taste and odor of the purified water.\n- Clean and replace the filtration layers periodically to maintain the efficiency of the solar water purifier.\n\n### Troubleshooting\n- If the water is not evaporating, check if the container is receiving sufficient sunlight.\n- If the purified water has an unusual taste or odor, replace the activated carbon or charcoal layer.\n- If the water is not flowing smoothly through the filtration layers, check for any blockages or clogs in the tubing.\n\n### Safety Measures\n- Handle sharp objects with care to avoid any injuries.\n- Use gloves and protective eyewear when handling chemicals or cleaning materials.\n- Avoid drinking unpurified water from the solar water purifier if you are unsure of its quality.\n\n### Common Mistakes to Avoid\n- Neglecting to clean the container properly before use can contaminate the purified water.\n- Placing the solar water purifier in a shaded area will limit its effectiveness.\n- Overfilling the container can lead to spillage and inefficient purification.\n\n### Summary and Key Takeaways\nBuilding a basic solar water purifier is a simple and effective way to obtain clean drinking water using solar energy. By following the step-by-step procedure outlined in this guide and considering the tips and safety measures, you can create a sustainable solution for purifying water in remote areas or during emergencies. Remember to regularly maintain and clean the filtration layers to ensure the efficiency of the solar water purifier."
