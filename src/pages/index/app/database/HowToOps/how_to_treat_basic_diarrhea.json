Foods like rice, bananas, and toast are gentle on the stomach and can help firm up stools.\n5. **Avoid certain foods and drinks**: Stay away from spicy, fatty, or greasy foods, as they can worsen diarrhea. Additionally, avoid caffeine, alcohol, and carbonated drinks, as they can dehydrate you further.\n6. **Practice good hygiene**: Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water after using the toilet to prevent the spread of bacteria or viruses.
