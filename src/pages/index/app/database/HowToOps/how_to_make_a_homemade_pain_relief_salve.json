In a double boiler or a heat-safe glass bowl placed over a pot of simmering water, melt the carrier oil and beeswax pellets together. Stir occasionally until fully melted and well combined.\n3. Once melted, remove the mixture from heat and allow it to cool slightly.\n4. Add the cayenne pepper powder, ginger powder, and turmeric powder to the oil and beeswax mixture.

Consider wearing gloves and avoid touching your face or eyes while working with it.\n\n### Troubleshooting\n- If the salve is too soft or runny, you can melt it again and add more beeswax pellets to thicken it.\n- If the salve is too hard, you can remelt it and add more carrier oil to soften it.\n\n### Safety Measures\n- Use caution when working with hot oil and beeswax to avoid burns. Always handle them with oven mitts or heat-resistant gloves.\n- Keep the mixture away from open flames or heat sources to prevent accidents.\n- If you have any allergies or sensitivities to the ingredients, perform a patch test before using the salve on a larger area.\n\n### Common Mistakes to Avoid\n- Avoid adding too much essential oil, as it can overpower the scent and potentially cause skin irritation.\n- Ensure that the containers used for storage are clean and dry to prevent contamination.\n\n### Summary and Key Takeaways\nMaking a homemade pain relief salve is a simple process that allows you to customize the ingredients to suit your needs.
