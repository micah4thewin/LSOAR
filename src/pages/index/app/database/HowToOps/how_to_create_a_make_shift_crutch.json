Whether you've injured your leg or are recovering from a surgery, creating a make shift crutch can provide the necessary assistance until you can obtain a proper crutch. This guide will walk you through the steps to create a make shift crutch using common household items.\n\n### Materials/Tools\nTo create a make shift crutch, you will need the following materials/tools:\n- A sturdy broomstick or wooden dowel\n- Duct tape or strong adhesive tape\n- A cushion or padding material (such as a towel or foam)\n- Scissors\n\n### Step-by-Step Procedure\n1. Start by selecting a sturdy broomstick or wooden dowel that is approximately the same height as your armpit to the floor. This will ensure the crutch provides proper support.\n2. Measure and mark the desired height on the broomstick or wooden dowel, and use the scissors to cut it to the appropriate length.\n3. Take the cushion or padding material and wrap it around the top of the broomstick or wooden dowel. Secure it in place using duct tape or strong adhesive tape. This will provide comfort and prevent any discomfort or pressure on your underarm.\n4. Stand upright and hold the make shift crutch with one hand. Place the padding under your armpit and adjust the height of the crutch so that your elbow is slightly bent when you hold onto the handle.\n5. Use duct tape or strong adhesive tape to reinforce the connection between the padding and the broomstick or wooden dowel. This will ensure that the padding remains securely in place.\n6. Repeat the process for the other side of the make shift crutch if needed.\n\n### Tips and Considerations\n- If you find that the make shift crutch is not providing enough support, consider using two crutches instead of one.\n- Make sure the padding is thick enough to provide comfort and prevent any discomfort or pressure on your underarm.\n- Adjust the height of the crutch to ensure your elbow is slightly bent when you hold onto the handle. This will help distribute your weight properly.\n\n### Troubleshooting\n- If the make shift crutch feels unstable or wobbly, double-check that the connections are secure and reinforce them with additional tape if necessary.\n- If the padding slips or moves during use, use more tape to secure it in place or consider using a different padding material that provides better grip.\n\n### Safety Measures\n- Take caution when using the make shift crutch and be aware of your surroundings to avoid tripping or falling.\n- Make sure the broomstick or wooden dowel is sturdy and can support your weight before using it as a crutch.\n- If you experience any pain or discomfort while using the make shift crutch, stop using it and consult a healthcare professional.\n\n### Common Mistakes to Avoid\n- Avoid using a broomstick or wooden dowel that is not sturdy enough to support your weight.\n- Do not create a make shift crutch that is too short or too tall for your height, as this can lead to improper support and discomfort.\n- Do not forget to secure the padding in place using tape, as it can slip or move during use.\n\n### Summary and Key Takeaways\nCreating a make shift crutch can provide temporary support for walking or mobility when a proper crutch is not available. By following the steps outlined in this guide and taking necessary safety precautions, you can create a make shift crutch using common household items. Remember to measure and cut the broomstick or wooden dowel to the appropriate height, secure padding in place using tape, and adjust the crutch to ensure proper support. Always prioritize safety and consult a healthcare professional if needed."
