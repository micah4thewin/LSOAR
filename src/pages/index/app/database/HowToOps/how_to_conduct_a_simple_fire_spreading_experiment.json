This experiment aims to demonstrate the behavior of fire and how it spreads in a controlled environment. By following this guide, you will gain a better understanding of the factors that contribute to fire spreading and the importance of fire safety.\n\n### Materials/Tools\n- Fireproof surface (e.g., metal tray)\n- Lighter or matches\n- Candles\n- Fire extinguisher or water source\n- Protective gloves\n- Safety goggles\n\n### Step-by-Step Procedure\n1. Choose a suitable location for the experiment, preferably outdoors or in a well-ventilated area away from flammable materials.\n2. Place the fireproof surface (metal tray) on a stable and non-flammable surface.\n3. Put on protective gloves and safety goggles to ensure personal safety.\n4. Arrange the candles on the fireproof surface, leaving enough space between them for observation.\n5. Light the first candle using a lighter or matches.\n6. Observe the behavior of the flame and how it spreads. Take note of the direction and speed of the spreading flame.\n7. After a few minutes, carefully light the second candle using the flame from the first candle. Observe how the flame spreads from one candle to another.\n8. Repeat the process, lighting subsequent candles using the flame from the previous candle until all candles are lit.\n9. Observe the final pattern of the flames and how they interact with each other.\n10. Once the experiment is complete, extinguish the flames using a fire extinguisher or water source.\n\n### Tips and Considerations\n- Conduct the experiment in a controlled environment to minimize the risk of accidents.\n- Ensure there are no flammable materials nearby that could catch fire.\n- Keep a safe distance from the flames and avoid leaning over the experiment.\n- Use candles of the same size and shape for consistent results.\n- Take notes and record observations throughout the experiment for future reference.\n\n### Troubleshooting\n- If the flames do not spread easily from one candle to another, ensure that the candles are positioned close enough to allow for easy ignition.\n- If the flames go out before reaching the next candle, check if there is sufficient airflow or oxygen supply to sustain the fire.\n\n### Safety Measures\n- Always wear protective gloves and safety goggles to prevent burns and eye injuries.\n- Have a fire extinguisher or water source nearby in case of emergencies.\n- Ensure the experiment is conducted in a well-ventilated area to prevent the accumulation of smoke.\n- Keep flammable materials away from the experiment area.\n- Do not leave the experiment unattended.\n\n### Common Mistakes to Avoid\n- Failing to take proper safety precautions.\n- Conducting the experiment indoors or in a confined space without proper ventilation.\n- Using flammable materials as the base surface instead of a fireproof surface.\n- Positioning the candles too far apart, making it difficult for the flames to spread.\n\n### Summary and Key Takeaways\nBy conducting a simple fire spreading experiment, you have gained insight into the behavior of fire and how it spreads. Remember to prioritize safety throughout the experiment by wearing protective gear and having fire extinguishing tools readily available. Always conduct the experiment in a controlled environment and avoid common mistakes that may compromise safety. Understanding fire behavior can help raise awareness about fire safety and the importance of preventive measures."
