Start by preparing the spoon. Cut off the handle of the plastic spoon using the scissors, leaving only the bowl-shaped part.\n2. Take the small funnel and tape it securely to the top of the spoon bowl. The narrow end of the funnel should be facing outwards.\n3. Attach the flashlight to the back of the spoon bowl using tape.
