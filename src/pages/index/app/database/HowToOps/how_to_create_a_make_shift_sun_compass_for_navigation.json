By using the sun's position in the sky, you can determine your approximate direction. This guide will walk you through the steps to create a simple sun compass using basic materials.\n\n### Materials/Tools\n- A stick or rod\n- A flat surface (e.g., the ground or a table)\n- A watch or clock with a minute hand\n- A clear and sunny day\n\n### Step-by-Step Procedure\n1. Find a clear and sunny location where you can easily see the sun's position in the sky.\n2. Place the stick or rod vertically into the ground or onto a flat surface.\n3. Use the watch or clock to determine the current time. Ensure that the watch or clock has a minute hand.\n4. Align the stick or rod so that it casts a shadow on the ground.\n5. Mark the tip of the shadow with a small object or by drawing a line.\n6. Wait for approximately 10-15 minutes.\n7. Observe the movement of the shadow and mark the new tip.\n8. Draw a straight line connecting the two marks.\n9. Stand with the first mark on your left and the second mark on your right.\n10. The line between the marks represents an approximate east-west direction.\n11. To determine north, stand with the first mark on your left and face the line between the marks. North will be in the direction opposite to the line.\n\n### Tips and Considerations\n- Choose a location with an unobstructed view of the sky to accurately observe the sun's position.\n- Ensure that the stick or rod is straight and firmly planted to prevent it from moving.\n- Repeat the process at different times of the day for more accurate results.\n- Remember that the sun's position changes throughout the year, so adjust your compass accordingly.\n\n### Troubleshooting\n- If the shadow is not clear or distinct, try adjusting the angle of the stick or rod to create a sharper shadow.\n- In case of cloudy weather, this method may not work as the sun's position may not be visible.\n\n### Safety Measures\n- Be cautious when handling the stick or rod to avoid injury.\n- Protect your eyes from direct exposure to the sun by wearing sunglasses or a hat.\n\n### Common Mistakes to Avoid\n- Failing to wait for the shadow to move before marking the second point can result in an inaccurate compass.\n- Neglecting to account for the sun's position changing throughout the day can lead to incorrect directions.\n\n### Summary and Key Takeaways\nCreating a make-shift sun compass can be a useful skill when traditional compasses are unavailable. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can determine approximate directions using the sun's position in the sky. Remember to choose a clear and sunny location, mark the shadow's movement, and align yourself correctly to get accurate results."
