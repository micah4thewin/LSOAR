Use a towel or cloth between the heat source and your skin.\n- Do not apply ice directly to the skin. Wrap it in a cloth or use a cold compress.\n- Follow the recommended dosage instructions for pain relievers and do not exceed the recommended limit.\n- If you have any underlying health conditions or allergies, consult a healthcare professional before taking pain relievers.\n\n### Common Mistakes to Avoid\n- Ignoring persistent or worsening joint pain.\n- Applying heat therapy too soon after an injury.\n- Applying excessive pressure with compression bandages or joint support braces.\n- Overexerting the affected joint before it has fully healed.\n\n### Summary and Key Takeaways\nTreating basic joint pain involves rest, cold therapy, heat therapy, pain relievers, compression, and joint support braces. It is important to consult a healthcare professional if the pain persists or worsens. Remember to take safety measures, avoid common mistakes, and prioritize rest and proper care for a speedy recovery."
