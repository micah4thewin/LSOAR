A solar still is a simple and effective way to distill water using the sun's heat. In this guide, we will walk you through the steps to build a basic solar still for water distillation.\n\n### Materials/Tools\n- Large glass or plastic container with a tight-fitting lid\n- Small container to collect distilled water\n- Plastic tubing\n- Plastic sheet or glass pane\n- Adhesive tape\n- Knife or scissors\n- Water source\n\n### Step-by-Step Procedure\n1. Choose a location with ample sunlight and a flat surface for your solar still.\n2. Place the large container in the chosen location and fill it with the water source you want to distill.\n3. Place the small container inside the large container, ensuring it floats in the water without touching the sides.\n4. Cut a piece of plastic tubing long enough to reach from the small container to the outside of the large container.\n5. Insert one end of the tubing into the small container, making sure it reaches the bottom.\n6. Place the other end of the tubing outside the large container, ensuring it is positioned lower than the small container.\n7. Cover the large container with the plastic sheet or glass pane, securing it tightly with adhesive tape.\n8. Create a slope in the plastic sheet or glass pane by propping one side up slightly higher than the other. This will help water condensation flow towards the small container.\n9. Place a weight on the higher side of the plastic sheet or glass pane to keep it in position.\n10. Wait for the sunlight to heat the water in the large container. As the water evaporates, it will condense on the plastic sheet or glass pane and drip into the small container through the tubing.\n11. Regularly check the small container and collect the distilled water.\n\n### Tips and Considerations\n- Choose a container with a dark color to help absorb more sunlight and accelerate the distillation process.\n- Ensure that the plastic tubing is securely attached to both the small container and the large container to prevent leaks.\n- If the water source contains large particles or debris, filter it before filling the large container to avoid clogging the tubing or contaminating the distilled water.\n\n### Troubleshooting\n- If the distilled water is not collecting in the small container, check for any leaks in the tubing or the seal of the large container.\n- Insufficient sunlight may result in slower distillation. Ensure the solar still is placed in a location with maximum sunlight exposure.\n- If the plastic sheet or glass pane becomes dirty or covered in condensation, clean it to improve the efficiency of the distillation process.\n\n### Safety Measures\n- Avoid direct contact with the water source, especially if it is contaminated or contains harmful substances.\n- Use caution when handling sharp tools such as knives or scissors.\n- Be careful when working with hot water or steam during the distillation process.\n\n### Common Mistakes to Avoid\n- Failing to secure the plastic sheet or glass pane tightly can result in air leaks, reducing the efficiency of the solar still.\n- Neglecting to clean the plastic sheet or glass pane regularly can hinder the condensation process.\n- Overfilling the large container may cause water to spill over and contaminate the distilled water.\n\n### Summary and Key Takeaways\nBuilding a basic solar still for water distillation is a straightforward process that can provide a reliable source of clean drinking water. By following the step-by-step procedure and considering the tips and safety measures, you can successfully create your own solar still and produce distilled water using the power of the sun. Remember to regularly collect and store the distilled water for future use. Stay hydrated and enjoy the benefits of this simple yet effective water purification method."
