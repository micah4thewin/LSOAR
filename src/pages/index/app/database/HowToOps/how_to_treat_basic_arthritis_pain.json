Consult with your healthcare provider to confirm your arthritis diagnosis and discuss treatment options.\n2. Take NSAIDs as prescribed or recommended by your healthcare provider to reduce pain and inflammation.\n3. Apply hot or cold packs to the affected joints for 15-20 minutes at a time, several times a day. Use cold packs for acute pain and swelling, and hot packs for chronic pain and stiffness.\n4. Use joint braces or supports to provide stability and relieve pressure on the affected joints. Follow the instructions provided with the braces or supports for proper usage.\n5. Apply topical creams or ointments specifically designed for arthritis pain relief to the affected areas. Follow the instructions on the packaging for application frequency and dosage.\n6. Engage in gentle exercises that promote joint mobility and flexibility. This can include activities such as stretching, range-of-motion exercises, and low-impact exercises like swimming or walking. Use appropriate exercise equipment if necessary.\n7. Use assistive devices like canes or walkers if needed to reduce stress on the joints and improve mobility.\n8. Maintain a healthy weight to reduce strain on the joints. Follow a balanced diet and engage in regular physical activity to achieve and maintain a healthy weight.\n9.

What works for one person may not work for another.\n- Keep a pain diary to track your symptoms, treatments, and their effectiveness.

Many arthritis treatments take time to show results, so be patient and stick to your routine.\n\n### Troubleshooting\n- If you experience severe or worsening pain, consult with your healthcare provider immediately.\n- If over-the-counter treatments are not providing sufficient relief, discuss other options with your healthcare provider.\n- If you have difficulty performing exercises or using certain treatments, seek guidance from a physical therapist or occupational therapist.\n\n### Safety Measures\n- Follow the recommended dosage instructions for NSAIDs and topical creams/ointments to avoid potential side effects.\n- Use hot or cold packs with caution to prevent burns or frostbite. Always wrap the packs in a towel or cloth before applying them to the skin.\n- When using joint braces or supports, ensure they are properly fitted and adjusted for maximum effectiveness and comfort.\n- Start any exercise program slowly and gradually increase intensity as tolerated. Stop any exercise that causes pain or discomfort.\n\n### Common Mistakes to Avoid\n- Avoid relying solely on medication for arthritis pain relief. Combining medication with other treatments can provide better results.\n- Do not ignore pain or push through it. Listen to your body and modify activities as needed to avoid further damage.\n- Do not overdo exercises or activities. Moderation is key to prevent excessive strain on the joints.\n\n### Summary and Key Takeaways\nTreating basic arthritis pain involves a combination of medication, physical therapies, and lifestyle modifications. Consult with a healthcare professional to develop a personalized treatment plan. Remember to use NSAIDs, hot/cold packs, joint braces, topical creams, and engage in gentle exercises.
