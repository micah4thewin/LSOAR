It is commonly used to monitor oxygen levels in patients with respiratory conditions. In this guide, we will learn how to make a homemade pulse oximeter using readily available materials.\n\n### Materials/Tools\n- Arduino Uno board\n- MAX30100 pulse oximeter sensor module\n- Breadboard\n- Jumper wires\n- USB cable\n- Computer with Arduino IDE installed\n\n### Step-by-Step Procedure\n1. Connect the Arduino Uno board to your computer using the USB cable.\n2. Launch the Arduino IDE on your computer.\n3. In the Arduino IDE, go to \"File\" > \"Examples\" > \"Wire\" and open the \"I2C Scanner\" example.\n4. Upload the I2C Scanner sketch to your Arduino Uno board.\n5. Open the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE.\n6. The Serial Monitor will display the I2C addresses of the connected devices. Look for the address of the MAX30100 pulse oximeter sensor module.\n7. Once you have identified the address, close the Serial Monitor and open a new sketch in the Arduino IDE.\n8. In the new sketch, go to \"Sketch\" > \"Include Library\" > \"Manage Libraries\".\n9. In the Library Manager, search for \"MAX30100\" and install the library.\n10. Import the MAX30100 library into your sketch by adding the following line at the beginning of your code:\n    ```cpp\n    #include <MAX30100.h>\n    ```\n11. Initialize the MAX30100 pulse oximeter sensor module in your code by adding the following lines:\n    ```cpp\n    MAX30100 oximeter;\n    oximeter.begin();\n    ```\n12. Set up the serial communication with your computer by adding the following line in the `setup()` function:\n    ```cpp\n    Serial.begin(9600);\n    ```\n13. In the `loop()` function, read the oxygen saturation level from the MAX30100 sensor and print it to the Serial Monitor using the following lines:\n    ```cpp\n    float spo2 = oximeter.getSpO2();\n    Serial.print(\"SpO2: \");\n    Serial.print(spo2);\n    Serial.println(\"%\");\n    ```\n14. Upload the code to your Arduino Uno board.\n15. Open the Serial Monitor to view the oxygen saturation level readings from the homemade pulse oximeter.\n\n### Tips and Considerations\n- Make sure to connect the MAX30100 pulse oximeter sensor module to the correct pins on the Arduino Uno board as specified in the library documentation.\n- Keep the sensor module away from sources of light that could interfere with its readings.\n- Ensure that the sensor module is properly attached to your finger or another body part for accurate readings.\n\n### Troubleshooting\n- If you're not getting any readings from the sensor, double-check the wiring connections and make sure the sensor module is functioning correctly.\n- If the readings are inconsistent or fluctuating, ensure that the sensor module is securely attached to your finger or body part and that there are no obstructions.\n\n### Safety Measures\n- Take necessary precautions when handling electronic components to avoid electrical shocks or damage.\n- Be cautious when attaching the sensor module to your finger or body part to prevent any discomfort or injury.\n\n### Common Mistakes to Avoid\n- Make sure to install the MAX30100 library correctly to avoid compilation errors.\n- Double-check the wiring connections to ensure they are correct and secure.\n- Avoid placing the sensor module in direct sunlight or near other sources of light that could affect its readings.\n\n### Summary and Key Takeaways\nIn this guide, we learned how to make a homemade pulse oximeter using an Arduino Uno board and a MAX30100 pulse oximeter sensor module. By following the step-by-step procedure, we were able to set up the Arduino board, install the necessary libraries, and read the oxygen saturation level from the sensor module. Remember to follow safety measures and consider the tips provided for accurate and reliable readings."
