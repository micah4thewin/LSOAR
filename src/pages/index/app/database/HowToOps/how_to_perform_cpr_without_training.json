While formal CPR training is highly recommended, there may be situations where you need to perform CPR without any training. This guide will provide a basic step-by-step procedure for performing CPR in an emergency situation.\n\n### Materials/Tools\nTo perform CPR without training, you will need the following materials/tools:\n- A firm surface to lay the person on (e.g., the ground or a table)\n- A phone to call emergency services\n- Your hands\n\n### Step-by-Step Procedure\n1. **Assess the situation**: Ensure the area is safe for you to approach and check if the person is responsive.\n2. **Call for help**: Dial the emergency services number in your country and provide them with your location and details about the situation.\n3. **Position the person**: Gently place the person on their back on a firm surface.\n4. **Open the airway**: Tilt the person's head back slightly and lift their chin to open the airway.\n5. **Check for breathing**: Look, listen, and feel for any signs of breathing for about 10 seconds. If the person is not breathing or only gasping, proceed to the next step.\n6. **Perform chest compressions**: Place the heel of one hand on the center of the person's chest, slightly above the lower half of the breastbone. Place your other hand on top of the first hand. Interlock your fingers and keep your elbows straight. Push hard and fast, aiming for a depth of about 2 inches. Perform compressions at a rate of around 100-120 compressions per minute.\n7. **Continue chest compressions**: Keep performing chest compressions until help arrives or the person starts showing signs of life.\n8. **Do not perform rescue breaths**: In the absence of training, it is recommended to focus solely on chest compressions and not perform rescue breaths.\n9. **Follow instructions from emergency services**: Once help arrives, follow the instructions given by the emergency services operator.\n\n### Tips and Considerations\n- If possible, ask someone nearby if they have CPR training and can take over.\n- If an automated external defibrillator (AED) is available, follow the instructions on the device.\n- Do not stop performing CPR until help arrives or the person shows signs of life.\n- If you feel tired, switch with someone nearby if possible.\n\n### Troubleshooting\n- If you are unsure about your technique, focus on performing chest compressions as best as you can.\n- If the person's ribs crack or break during compressions, it is normal and necessary to provide effective CPR.\n\n### Safety Measures\n- Ensure the area is safe before approaching the person.\n- Be cautious of any potential hazards, such as traffic or dangerous objects.\n- If the person is in water, move them to a dry area before starting CPR.\n\n### Common Mistakes to Avoid\n- Avoid leaning on the person's chest between compressions, as it can reduce the effectiveness of CPR.\n- Do not perform rescue breaths if you are not trained to do so.\n- Do not delay calling emergency services before starting CPR.\n\n### Summary and Key Takeaways\nPerforming CPR without training is a challenging task, but it can make a significant difference in saving someone's life. Remember these key points:\n- Call emergency services and provide details about the situation.\n- Perform chest compressions at a rate of around 100-120 compressions per minute.\n- Do not perform rescue breaths unless you are trained to do so.\n- Continue performing CPR until help arrives or the person shows signs of life."
