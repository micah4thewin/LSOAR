In this guide, we will demonstrate how to create a make-shift bedside table using readily available medical supplies. This solution can be a temporary fix until a proper bedside table is obtained.\n\n### Materials/Tools\n- Overbed table (adjustable height)\n- IV pole or IV stand\n- Sterile tray or medical tray\n- Medical tape\n- Optional: Bedside lamp\n\n### Step-by-Step Procedure\n1. Start by positioning the overbed table next to the bed, ensuring it is at a comfortable height for easy access.\n2. Attach the IV pole or IV stand to the side of the overbed table using the provided clamps or attachments. Make sure it is securely fastened.\n3. Place the sterile tray or medical tray on top of the overbed table. This will serve as the surface for your make-shift bedside table.\n4. If desired, attach a bedside lamp to the overbed table using the provided clamp or attachment. Ensure it is properly secured and positioned for optimal lighting.\n5. Organize your medical supplies on the sterile tray. You can place items such as medications, tissues, water, or any other items you may need within reach.\n6. Use medical tape to secure any loose items to the tray or table, preventing them from falling or sliding off.\n7. Adjust the height of the overbed table and IV pole as needed to ensure it aligns with the height of the bed and is easily accessible.\n\n### Tips and Considerations\n- Consider using a tablecloth or covering the sterile tray with a cloth to make it more visually appealing.\n- If the overbed table does not have enough space, consider using additional trays or containers to hold extra items.\n- Make sure to clean and sanitize the make-shift bedside table regularly to maintain hygiene.\n\n### Troubleshooting\n- If the overbed table is unstable or wobbly, double-check that all clamps and attachments are securely fastened.\n- If the IV pole or stand is not tall enough, consider using an adjustable extension pole or finding an alternative stand that meets your needs.\n\n### Safety Measures\n- Ensure the overbed table is stable and securely positioned next to the bed.\n- Be cautious when adjusting the height of the overbed table or IV pole to avoid pinching fingers or causing any injuries.\n- Keep the make-shift bedside table organized and free from clutter to prevent accidents or items falling onto the bed.\n\n### Common Mistakes to Avoid\n- Avoid overloading the make-shift bedside table with heavy items that could cause it to tip over.\n- Do not leave any sharp or hazardous objects unsecured on the table.\n- Avoid placing any liquids directly on the table without a secure lid or cover to prevent spills.\n\n### Summary and Key Takeaways\nCreating a make-shift bedside table using medical supplies can be a practical solution in emergency situations or when conventional furniture is not available. By following these steps, you can quickly set up a functional and accessible surface for your bedside needs. Remember to prioritize safety, cleanliness, and organization throughout the process."
