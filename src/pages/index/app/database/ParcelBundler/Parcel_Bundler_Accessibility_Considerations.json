When developing applications with Parcel, it is important to consider accessibility to ensure that your web application is usable by people with disabilities. This documentation will guide you through the accessibility considerations you should keep in mind when using Parcel bundler.\n\n### Objective and Scope\nThe objective of this documentation is to provide guidance on how to make your web application accessible when using Parcel bundler. It covers the requirements, step-by-step instructions, code snippets, troubleshooting tips, and best practices for ensuring accessibility in your Parcel-based projects.\n\n### Requirements and Pre-requisites\nTo follow this documentation, you should have a basic understanding of web development, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You will also need to have Parcel installed on your machine. If you haven't installed Parcel yet, you can do so by running the following command:\n\n```\nnpm install -g parcel-bundler\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Instructions\n1. **Include Accessibility Markup**: Ensure that your HTML markup includes appropriate accessibility features such as semantic elements, ARIA roles, and labels for form controls. This will help screen readers and assistive technologies understand the structure and purpose of your web application.\n\n2. **Manage Focus**: Use JavaScript to manage focus when interacting with dynamic elements or components. This ensures that keyboard users can navigate and interact with your web application easily.\n\n3. **Provide Alternative Text for Images**: Include descriptive alternative text for images using the `alt` attribute. This allows screen readers to convey the meaning of the images to visually impaired users.\n\n4. **Use Semantic Headings**: Use proper heading tags (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.) to structure your content. This helps screen readers and other assistive technologies understand the hierarchy and organization of your web page.\n\n5. **Ensure Color Contrast**: Check the color contrast of your text and background colors to ensure readability for users with low vision. Use tools like the WebAIM Color Contrast Checker to verify that your color combinations meet the WCAG 2.1 guidelines.\n\n6. **Keyboard Accessibility**: Ensure that all interactive elements, such as buttons and links, can be accessed and activated using the keyboard alone. Test your web application using only the keyboard to ensure a seamless experience for keyboard users.\n\n7. **Test with Screen Readers**: Test your web application with screen readers like NVDA (NonVisual Desktop Access) or VoiceOver to identify any accessibility issues. Screen readers can help you understand how users with visual impairments experience your web application.\n\n### Code Snippets and Commands\n- To build your Parcel project, use the following command:\n  ```\n  parcel build src/index.html\n  ```\n\n- Example of including an accessible form control with a label in your HTML:\n  ```html\n  <label for=\"email\">Email:</label>\n  <input type=\"email\" id=\"email\" name=\"email\" required>\n  ```\n\n### Troubleshooting and Common Issues\n- **Issue**: Parcel does not include accessibility-related packages by default.\n  - **Solution**: Install the necessary packages for accessibility support in your project, such as `aria-hidden`, `focus-trap`, or any other package that meets your specific accessibility requirements.\n\n- **Issue**: Accessibility issues are not detected during development.\n  - **Solution**: Use automated accessibility testing tools like Axe or Lighthouse to identify accessibility issues in your web application. These tools can be integrated into your development workflow to catch accessibility problems early on.\n\n### Best Practices and Recommendations\n- Follow the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) to ensure your web application meets the accessibility standards.\n- Regularly test your web application for accessibility using automated tools and manual testing with assistive technologies.\n- Document any accessibility-specific features or considerations in your project's documentation to ensure future maintainers are aware of them.\n\n### Summary and Conclusion\nConsidering accessibility when using Parcel bundler is crucial to ensure that your web application is usable by all users, regardless of their abilities. By following the step-by-step instructions, code snippets, and best practices provided in this documentation, you can make your Parcel-based projects more accessible and inclusive. Remember to regularly test and maintain accessibility in your web applications to provide an optimal user experience for everyone."
