  "article": "## Parcel Bundler Linting with ESLint\n\n### Introduction\n\nParcel is a web application bundler that simplifies the process of building modern web applications. It provides a zero-configuration setup, allowing developers to focus on writing code rather than configuring build tools. One important aspect of developing high-quality code is linting, which helps identify and fix potential errors and maintain consistent coding styles. In this documentation, we will explore how to set up linting with ESLint in a Parcel project.\n\n### Objective and Scope\n\nThe objective of this documentation is to guide developers in setting up and configuring ESLint for linting in a Parcel project. We will cover the necessary requirements, step-by-step instructions, relevant code snippets and commands, troubleshooting common issues, and best practices for optimal linting configuration.\n\n### Requirements and Pre-requisites\n\nBefore proceeding with setting up linting with ESLint in a Parcel project, ensure that you have the following requirements and pre-requisites in place:\n\n- Node.js and npm installed on your system\n- A Parcel project set up and running\n\n### Step-by-Step Instructions\n\nFollow the step-by-step instructions below to set up and configure ESLint for linting in your Parcel project:\n\n1. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the root directory of your Parcel project.\n\n2. Install ESLint and the necessary plugins by running the following command:\n\n   ```\n   npm install eslint eslint-plugin-import eslint-plugin-react eslint-plugin-react-hooks --save-dev\n   ```\n\n3. Create an ESLint configuration file named `.eslintrc.json` in the root directory of your project. You can use the following command to create the file:\n\n   ```\n   touch .eslintrc.json\n   ```\n\n4. Open the `.eslintrc.json` file in a text editor and add the following configuration:\n\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"extends\": [\"eslint:recommended\", \"plugin:react/recommended\"],\n     \"plugins\": [\"react\", \"react-hooks\"],\n     \"parserOptions\": {\n       \"ecmaVersion\": 2020,\n       \"sourceType\": \"module\",\n       \"ecmaFeatures\": {\n         \"jsx\": true\n       }\n     },\n     \"rules\": {\n       \"react-hooks/rules-of-hooks\": \"error\",\n       \"react-hooks/exhaustive-deps\": \"warn\"\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n   This configuration extends the recommended ESLint rules and includes the necessary plugins for linting React code and enforcing React Hooks rules.\n\n5. Create a new script in your `package.json` file to run ESLint. Open the `package.json` file and add the following script:\n\n   ```json\n   \"scripts\": {\n     \"lint\": \"eslint src\"\n   }\n   ```\n\n   This script runs ESLint on the `src` directory of your project. You can modify the directory as per your project structure.\n\n6. Run ESLint by executing the following command:\n\n   ```\n   npm run lint\n   ```\n\n   ESLint will now analyze your code and display any linting errors or warnings in the terminal.\n\n7. (Optional) Set up ESLint integration with your code editor to get real-time linting feedback as you write code. Refer to your code editor's documentation for instructions on how to install and configure ESLint integration.\n\n### Code Snippets and Commands\n\n- Install ESLint and necessary plugins:\n\n  ```\n  npm install eslint eslint-plugin-import eslint-plugin-react eslint-plugin-react-hooks --save-dev\n  ```\n\n- Create `.eslintrc.json` file:\n\n  ```\n  touch .eslintrc.json\n  ```\n\n- Run ESLint:\n\n  ```\n  npm run lint\n  ```\n\n### Troubleshooting and Common Issues\n\n- **ESLint not detecting linting errors**: Ensure that the ESLint configuration file (`.eslintrc.json`) is correctly set up and located in the root directory of your project. Verify that the linting rules and plugins are properly configured.\n\n- **ESLint not running on the correct directory**: Double-check the `src` directory specified in the ESLint script in your `package.json` file. Make sure it matches your project's directory structure.\n\n### Best Practices and Recommendations\n\n- Regularly run ESLint to catch and fix linting errors and warnings in your codebase.\n\n- Customize the ESLint configuration to match your project's coding style and preferences. You can modify the rules and plugins in the `.eslintrc.json` file.\n\n- Consider adding ESLint pre-commit hooks to ensure linting errors are fixed before committing code.\n\n### Summary and Conclusion\n\nIn this documentation, we explored how to set up linting with ESLint in a Parcel project. We covered the necessary requirements, step-by-step instructions, relevant code snippets and commands, troubleshooting common issues, and best practices for optimal linting configuration. By following these instructions, you can ensure the quality and consistency of your codebase by catching and fixing potential errors and maintaining a uniform coding style."
