It requires zero configuration and supports various file types out of the box. In this documentation, we will learn how to automate tasks using NPM scripts with Parcel Bundler.\n\n### Objective and Scope\nThe objective of this documentation is to provide step-by-step instructions on how to automate tasks using NPM scripts with Parcel Bundler. We will cover the necessary requirements, pre-requisites, and provide code snippets and commands to help you get started. Additionally, we will address common issues and provide best practices and recommendations for optimal usage.\n\n### Requirements and Pre-requisites\nBefore proceeding, ensure that you have the following requirements and pre-requisites:\n\n- Node.js and NPM installed on your machine.\n- Basic knowledge of JavaScript and NPM.\n\n### Step-by-Step Instructions\nFollow these step-by-step instructions to automate tasks using NPM scripts with Parcel Bundler:\n\n1. Create a new project directory and navigate to it in your terminal.\n2. Initialize a new NPM project by running the following command:\n   ```\n   npm init -y\n   ```\n3. Install Parcel Bundler as a development dependency by running the following command:\n   ```\n   npm install parcel-bundler --save-dev\n   ```\n4. Open the `package.json` file in your project directory and locate the `\"scripts\"` section.\n5. Add the following script to the `\"scripts\"` section:\n   ```json\n   \"scripts\": {\n     \"start\": \"parcel index.html\",\n     \"build\": \"parcel build index.html\"\n   }\n   ```\n   This script defines two commands: `start` and `build`. The `start` command runs the development server, while the `build` command creates a production-ready build.\n6. Save the `package.json` file.\n7. Create an `index.html` file in your project directory. This will be the entry point for your application.\n8. Create a `src` directory in your project directory.\n9. Create your JavaScript and CSS files inside the `src` directory.\n10. To start the development server, run the following command:\n    ```\n    npm start\n    ```\n    This will start the development server and open your application in the browser.\n11. To create a production-ready build, run the following command:\n    ```\n    npm run build\n    ```\n    This will create a `dist` directory with the bundled and optimized files.\n\n### Code Snippets and Commands\nHere are some relevant code snippets and commands for automating tasks with Parcel Bundler using NPM scripts:\n\n- Install Parcel Bundler:\n  ```\n  npm install parcel-bundler --save-dev\n  ```\n\n- Start the development server:\n  ```\n  npm start\n  ```\n\n- Create a production-ready build:\n  ```\n  npm run build\n  ```\n\n### Troubleshooting and Common Issues\nIf you encounter any issues or errors while using Parcel Bundler with NPM scripts, consider the following troubleshooting steps:\n\n- Make sure you have installed Parcel Bundler as a development dependency.\n- Double-check the script commands in your `package.json` file.\n- Ensure that your entry point file (`index.html`) and source files are correctly located.\n- Check for any error messages in the terminal output.\n\n### Best Practices and Recommendations\nTo make the most out of Parcel Bundler and NPM scripts, consider the following best practices and recommendations:\n\n- Use separate development and production scripts to optimize your workflow.\n- Utilize Parcel's built-in support for various file types, such as CSS, SCSS, HTML, and JavaScript.\n- Take advantage of Parcel's hot module replacement feature for quicker development iterations.\n- Regularly update Parcel and other dependencies to benefit from bug fixes and new features.\n\n### Summary and Conclusion\nAutomating tasks with NPM scripts and Parcel Bundler can greatly simplify your web development workflow. By following the step-by-step instructions in this documentation, you should now be able to set up and use NPM scripts to start the development server and create production-ready builds with Parcel Bundler. Remember to troubleshoot any issues, follow best practices, and regularly update your dependencies for optimal performance. Happy coding!"
