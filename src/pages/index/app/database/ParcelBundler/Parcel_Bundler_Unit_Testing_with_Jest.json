Jest is a JavaScript testing framework that provides a simple and intuitive way to write unit tests. This documentation will guide you through the process of setting up and using Jest for unit testing in a Parcel-bundled project.\n\n### Objective and Scope\nThe objective of this documentation is to provide step-by-step instructions on how to set up Jest for unit testing in a Parcel-bundled project. It covers the necessary requirements and pre-requisites, as well as best practices and recommendations for effective unit testing.\n\n### Requirements and Pre-requisites\nBefore proceeding with the unit testing setup, make sure you have the following requirements and pre-requisites in place:\n\n- Node.js installed on your machine\n- A Parcel-bundled project\n- Basic knowledge of JavaScript and unit testing concepts\n\n### Step-by-Step Instructions\nFollow these step-by-step instructions to set up Jest for unit testing in your Parcel-bundled project:\n\n1. Install Jest as a dev dependency by running the following command in your project directory:\n   ```\n   npm install --save-dev jest\n   ```\n\n2. Create a `__tests__` directory in the root of your project. This is where you will store your unit tests.\n\n3. Write your unit tests inside the `__tests__` directory. Jest uses a specific naming convention for test files. For example, if you have a file named `math.js`, your test file should be named `math.test.js` or `math.spec.js`.\n\n4. In your `package.json` file, add the following script under the `scripts` section:\n   ```\n   \"test\": \"jest\"\n   ```\n\n5. Run the tests by executing the following command in your project directory:\n   ```\n   npm test\n   ```\n\n6. Jest will automatically run all the tests in your `__tests__` directory and display the results in the terminal.\n\n### Code Snippets and Commands\nHere are some relevant code snippets and commands that you may find useful:\n\n- Install Jest:\n  ```\n  npm install --save-dev jest\n  ```\n\n- Run tests:\n  ```\n  npm test\n  ```\n\n### Troubleshooting and Common Issues\nIf you encounter any issues while setting up or running Jest with Parcel, here are some common troubleshooting steps:\n\n- Make sure you have installed Jest as a dev dependency.\n- Ensure that your unit test files are named correctly according to the Jest naming convention.\n- Check your `package.json` file for any errors or missing configurations.\n- Verify that your unit tests are written correctly and cover the desired functionality.\n\n### Best Practices and Recommendations\nTo make the most out of Jest for unit testing in a Parcel-bundled project, consider the following best practices:\n\n- Write clear and concise test cases that cover different scenarios.\n- Use descriptive test names to make it easier to understand the purpose of each test.\n- Utilize Jest's built-in assertion functions to check expected results.\n- Take advantage of Jest's mocking capabilities to isolate dependencies and test specific parts of your code.\n\n### Summary and Conclusion\nIn this documentation, we have learned how to set up and use Jest for unit testing in a Parcel-bundled project. By following the step-by-step instructions and best practices, you can ensure the quality and reliability of your code through effective unit testing."
