It covers the requirements, pre-requisites, and best practices for implementing responsive images and assets using Parcel Bundler.\n\n### Requirements and Pre-requisites\nBefore proceeding with the instructions, ensure that you have the following requirements and pre-requisites in place:\n- Node.js and npm installed on your machine\n- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript\n- A web application project set up with Parcel Bundler\n\n### Step-by-Step Instructions\n1. Install Parcel Bundler by running the following command in your terminal:\n   ```\n   npm install -g parcel-bundler\n   ```\n\n2. Create an HTML file for your web application and include the necessary markup for responsive images. For example:\n   ```html\n   <img src=\"image.jpg\" alt=\"Responsive Image\" srcset=\"image.jpg 1x, image@2x.jpg 2x, image@3x.jpg 3x\">\n   ```\n\n3. In your CSS file, define the styles for the responsive images. For example:\n   ```css\n   img {\n     max-width: 100%;\n     height: auto;\n   }\n   ```\n\n4. Import the images in your JavaScript file. For example:\n   ```javascript\n   import image from './image.jpg';\n   import image2x from './image@2x.jpg';\n   import image3x from './image@3x.jpg';\n   ```\n\n5. Use the imported images in your JavaScript code. For example:\n   ```javascript\n   const img = document.querySelector('img');\n   img.src = image;\n   img.srcset = `${image} 1x, ${image2x} 2x, ${image3x} 3x`;\n   ```\n\n6. Build your web application using Parcel Bundler by running the following command in your terminal:\n   ```\n   parcel build index.html\n   ```\n\n7.
