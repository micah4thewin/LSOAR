It automatically detects and bundles your project's dependencies, making it easier to get started with web development. One of the key features of Parcel is its support for customizing the Babel configuration.\n\n### Objective and Scope\nThe objective of this documentation is to provide step-by-step instructions on how to customize the Babel configuration in Parcel bundler. It will cover the requirements, pre-requisites, and best practices for customizing the Babel configuration.\n\n### Requirements and Pre-requisites\nTo customize the Babel configuration in Parcel bundler, you will need the following:\n\n- Node.js and npm installed on your machine\n- A basic understanding of JavaScript and Babel\n\n### Step-by-Step Instructions\nFollow these steps to customize the Babel configuration in Parcel bundler:\n\n1. Create a new project or navigate to an existing project directory.\n2. Install Parcel bundler globally by running the following command in your terminal:\n   ```\n   npm install -g parcel-bundler\n   ```\n3. Initialize a new project by running the following command in your terminal:\n   ```\n   npm init -y\n   ```\n4. Install the necessary dependencies by running the following command in your terminal:\n   ```\n   npm install --save-dev @babel/core @babel/preset-env\n   ```\n5.
