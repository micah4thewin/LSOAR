  "article": "## Parcel Bundler Authentication Flows\n\n### Introduction\nParcel is a web application bundler that enables developers to build and bundle their JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and other assets for deployment. It offers a simple and intuitive configuration-free setup, making it a popular choice among developers. One important aspect of web applications is authentication, which allows users to securely access their accounts and data. This documentation will guide you through the authentication flows in Parcel bundler.\n\n### Objective and Scope\nThe objective of this documentation is to provide a step-by-step guide on implementing authentication flows in Parcel bundler. It will cover the necessary requirements and pre-requisites, as well as provide detailed instructions and code snippets to help you set up authentication in your Parcel project. Additionally, it will address common issues and provide best practices and recommendations for a smooth authentication implementation.\n\n### Requirements and Pre-requisites\nBefore proceeding with the authentication flows in Parcel bundler, ensure that you have the following requirements and pre-requisites in place:\n\n- Node.js and npm installed on your machine\n- Basic knowledge of JavaScript and web development concepts\n- A Parcel project set up and running\n\n### Step-by-Step Instructions\nFollow these step-by-step instructions to implement authentication flows in Parcel bundler:\n\n1. Install the necessary dependencies:\n```bash\nnpm install express passport passport-local bcrypt\n```\n\n2. Create a `login.html` file with a login form:\n```html\n<form action=\"/login\" method=\"POST\">\n  <input type=\"text\" name=\"username\" placeholder=\"Username\" required>\n  <input type=\"password\" name=\"password\" placeholder=\"Password\" required>\n  <button type=\"submit\">Login</button>\n</form>\n```\n\n3. Create a `register.html` file with a registration form:\n```html\n<form action=\"/register\" method=\"POST\">\n  <input type=\"text\" name=\"username\" placeholder=\"Username\" required>\n  <input type=\"password\" name=\"password\" placeholder=\"Password\" required>\n  <button type=\"submit\">Register</button>\n</form>\n```\n\n4. Create a `server.js` file to handle the authentication logic:\n```javascript\nconst express = require('express');\nconst passport = require('passport');\nconst LocalStrategy = require('passport-local').Strategy;\nconst bcrypt = require('bcrypt');\n\n// Set up Express app\nconst app = express();\n\n// Configure Passport with LocalStrategy\npassport.use(new LocalStrategy(\n  (username, password, done) => {\n    // Replace with actual user authentication logic\n    const user = getUserByUsername(username);\n    if (!user) {\n      return done(null, false, { message: 'Incorrect username' });\n    }\n    if (!bcrypt.compareSync(password, user.password)) {\n      return done(null, false, { message: 'Incorrect password' });\n    }\n    return done(null, user);\n  }\n));\n\n// Set up Express routes\napp.post('/login', passport.authenticate('local', {\n  successRedirect: '/dashboard',\n  failureRedirect: '/login'\n}));\n\napp.post('/register', (req, res) => {\n  // Replace with actual user registration logic\n  const { username, password } = req.body;\n  const hashedPassword = bcrypt.hashSync(password, 10);\n  saveUser({ username, password: hashedPassword });\n  res.redirect('/login');\n});\n\n// Start the server\napp.listen(3000, () => {\n  console.log('Server started on port 3000');\n});\n```\n\n5. Start the server:\n```bash\nnode server.js\n```\n\n6. Access the login and registration forms in your browser at `http://localhost:3000/login` and `http://localhost:3000/register` respectively.\n\n7. Implement the necessary backend logic in the `getUserByUsername`, `bcrypt.compareSync`, and `saveUser` functions to interact with your user database.\n\n### Code Snippets and Commands\nHere are some relevant code snippets and commands used in the authentication flows:\n\n- Install dependencies:\n```bash\nnpm install express passport passport-local bcrypt\n```\n\n- Start the server:\n```bash\nnode server.js\n```\n\n### Troubleshooting and Common Issues\nIf you encounter any issues during the authentication implementation in Parcel bundler, consider the following troubleshooting steps:\n\n- Ensure that all dependencies are installed correctly.\n- Check for any syntax errors or typos in your code.\n- Verify that your backend logic for user authentication and registration is correct.\n- Debug any errors or warnings shown in the console.\n\n### Best Practices and Recommendations\nTo ensure optimal performance and security in your authentication implementation with Parcel bundler, consider the following best practices and recommendations:\n\n- Store user passwords securely using bcrypt or a similar hashing algorithm.\n- Implement session management to keep users logged in across requests.\n- Use HTTPS for secure communication between the client and server.\n- Implement rate limiting and other security measures to protect against brute-force attacks.\n\n### Summary and Conclusion\nAuthentication is a crucial aspect of web applications, and Parcel bundler provides a flexible and straightforward way to implement authentication flows. This documentation has guided you through the step-by-step process of setting up authentication in Parcel bundler, from installing dependencies to implementing the necessary backend logic. By following best practices and recommendations, you can ensure a secure and efficient authentication implementation in your Parcel project."
