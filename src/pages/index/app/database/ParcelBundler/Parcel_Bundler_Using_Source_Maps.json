One of the key features of Parcel is its support for source maps. Source maps allow developers to debug and trace issues in their code by mapping the bundled code back to the original source code.\n\nThis documentation will provide you with step-by-step instructions on how to use source maps with Parcel bundler.\n\n### Objective and Scope\nThe objective of this documentation is to guide developers on how to configure and use source maps with Parcel bundler. The scope of this documentation covers the installation, configuration, and usage of source maps in Parcel.\n\n### Requirements and Pre-requisites\nTo use source maps with Parcel bundler, you will need the following:\n\n- Node.js and npm installed on your machine\n- A basic understanding of JavaScript and web development concepts\n\n### Step-by-Step Instructions\n1. Install Parcel bundler globally by running the following command in your terminal:\n   ```\n   npm install -g parcel-bundler\n   ```\n\n2. Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it:\n   ```\n   mkdir my-project\n   cd my-project\n   ```\n\n3. Initialize a new npm project by running the following command:\n   ```\n   npm init -y\n   ```\n\n4. Install the required dependencies, including Parcel bundler:\n   ```\n   npm install parcel-bundler --save-dev\n   ```\n\n5. Create an `index.html` file in the root of your project and add the following content:\n   ```html\n   <!DOCTYPE html>\n   <html>\n   <head>\n     <title>Parcel Source Maps</title>\n   </head>\n   <body>\n     <script src=\"./src/index.js\"></script>\n   </body>\n   </html>\n   ```\n\n6. Create a new directory called `src` in the root of your project and navigate into it:\n   ```\n   mkdir src\n   cd src\n   ```\n\n7. Create an `index.js` file in the `src` directory and add the following content:\n   ```javascript\n   function add(a, b) {\n     return a + b;\n   }\n\n   console.log(add(2, 3));\n   ```\n\n8. Build your project with Parcel by running the following command in the root of your project:\n   ```\n   parcel build index.html --source-maps\n   ```\n\n9. Parcel will bundle your project and generate the source maps. You can find the bundled files and source maps in the `dist` directory.\n\n10. Open the bundled `index.html` file in your browser and open the developer console. You should see the result of the `console.log` statement from your original source code.\n\n### Code Snippets and Commands\n- Install Parcel bundler globally:\n  ```\n  npm install -g parcel-bundler\n  ```\n\n- Initialize a new npm project:\n  ```\n  npm init -y\n  ```\n\n- Install Parcel bundler as a development dependency:\n  ```\n  npm install parcel-bundler --save-dev\n  ```\n\n- Build your project with Parcel and generate source maps:\n  ```\n  parcel build index.html --source-maps\n  ```\n\n### Troubleshooting and Common Issues\n- If you encounter any issues during the installation or usage of Parcel bundler, make sure you have the latest version of Node.js and npm installed on your machine.\n\n- If the source maps are not generated or not working as expected, double-check your build command and ensure that you have included the `--source-maps` flag.\n\n### Best Practices and Recommendations\n- Use source maps during development to easily trace issues in your code and debug your web application.\n\n- Do not include source maps in your production build to reduce the bundle size and improve performance.\n\n- Keep your original source code organized and well-structured to make it easier to trace issues in the bundled code.\n\n### Summary and Conclusion\nIn this documentation, we have explored how to use source maps with Parcel bundler. Source maps are a powerful tool that allows developers to debug and trace issues in their code by mapping the bundled code back to the original source code. By following the step-by-step instructions provided, you should now be able to configure and use source maps with Parcel bundler in your web development projects."
