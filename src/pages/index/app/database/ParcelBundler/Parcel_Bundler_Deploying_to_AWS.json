By following these instructions, you will be able to deploy your application to AWS and make it accessible to users.\n\n### Objective and Scope\nThe objective of this documentation is to guide you through the process of deploying a project bundled with Parcel Bundler to AWS. The scope of this documentation includes the necessary requirements, step-by-step instructions, code snippets, troubleshooting tips, best practices, and recommendations.\n\n### Requirements and Pre-requisites\nBefore proceeding with the deployment process, ensure that you have the following requirements and pre-requisites in place:\n\n- An AWS account\n- A project bundled with Parcel Bundler\n- Basic knowledge of AWS services like EC2 and S3\n- Basic knowledge of the command line interface (CLI)\n\n### Step-by-Step Instructions\nFollow these step-by-step instructions to deploy your project bundled with Parcel Bundler to AWS:\n\n1. Create an EC2 instance on AWS:\n   - Log in to your AWS account.\n   - Navigate to the EC2 service.\n   - Click on \"Launch Instance\" to create a new instance.\n   - Select an appropriate AMI (Amazon Machine Image) for your project.\n   - Choose an instance type and configure the instance details.\n   - Set up the storage, security groups, and other settings as required.\n   - Review and launch the instance.\n\n2. Connect to the EC2 instance:\n   - Once the instance is launched, you will receive a key pair.\n   - Use this key pair to connect to the instance using SSH or any other preferred method.\n\n3. Install Node.js and NPM on the EC2 instance:\n   - Update the package manager using the following command:\n     ```\n     sudo apt-get update\n     ```\n   - Install Node.js and NPM using the following commands:\n     ```\n     sudo apt-get install nodejs\n     sudo apt-get install npm\n     ```\n\n4. Transfer your bundled project to the EC2 instance:\n   - Use SCP (Secure Copy Protocol) or any other preferred method to transfer your bundled project to the EC2 instance.\n\n5. Install project dependencies:\n   - Navigate to the project directory on the EC2 instance.\n   - Run the following command to install the project dependencies:\n     ```\n     npm install\n     ```\n\n6. Start the project on the EC2 instance:\n   - Run the following command to start the project on the EC2 instance:\n     ```\n     npm start\n     ```\n\n7. Access your deployed project:\n   - Obtain the public IP address of the EC2 instance.\n   - Open a web browser and enter the public IP address to access your deployed project.\n\n### Code Snippets and Commands\nHere are some relevant code snippets and commands that you may find useful during the deployment process:\n\n- Command to install Node.js and NPM:\n  ```\n  sudo apt-get install nodejs\n  sudo apt-get install npm\n  ```\n\n- Command to install project dependencies:\n  ```\n  npm install\n  ```\n\n- Command to start the project:\n  ```\n  npm start\n  ```\n\n### Troubleshooting and Common Issues\nIf you encounter any issues during the deployment process, refer to the following troubleshooting tips:\n\n- Ensure that you have the necessary permissions and access rights on AWS.\n- Double-check the configuration settings of your EC2 instance.\n- Verify that the project dependencies are correctly installed.\n- Check the logs for any error messages or warnings.\n- Make sure that the necessary ports are open and accessible.\n\n### Best Practices and Recommendations\nTo ensure optimal performance and security, consider the following best practices and recommendations:\n\n- Regularly update your AWS services and packages to the latest versions.\n- Implement security measures like SSL certificates and access control policies.\n- Monitor the performance of your deployed project and optimize as needed.\n- Backup your project and data regularly to prevent data loss.\n\n### Summary and Conclusion\nIn this documentation, we have provided detailed instructions on how to deploy a project bundled with Parcel Bundler to AWS. By following these instructions, you should be able to successfully deploy your application and make it accessible to users. Remember to follow best practices and recommendations for optimal performance and security."
