Git is a version control system that helps you track changes to your codebase and collaborate with other developers. This documentation explains how to integrate Git version control with Parcel bundler for effective code management and collaboration.\n\n## Objective and Scope\nThe objective of this documentation is to provide step-by-step instructions on how to use Git version control with Parcel bundler. It covers the setup process, basic Git commands, and best practices for managing your codebase.\n\n## Requirements and Pre-requisites\nTo follow this documentation, you need the following requirements and pre-requisites:\n- Git installed on your system\n- Parcel bundler installed on your system\n- A project set up with Parcel bundler\n\n## Step-by-Step Instructions\n1. Initialize Git in your project directory by running the following command:\n   ```\n   git init\n   ```\n\n2. Create a `.gitignore` file in your project directory to specify files and directories that should be ignored by Git. This file helps prevent unnecessary files from being tracked. Example `.gitignore` file:\n   ```\n   node_modules/\n   dist/\n   .cache/\n   ```\n\n3. Add your project files to the Git repository by running the following command:\n   ```\n   git add .\n   ```\n\n4. Commit your changes with a descriptive message by running the following command:\n   ```\n   git commit -m \"Initial commit\"\n   ```\n\n5. Set up a remote repository on a Git hosting service like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.\n\n6. Add the remote repository URL to your local repository by running the following command:\n   ```\n   git remote add origin <remote_repository_url>\n   ```\n\n7. Push your local repository to the remote repository by running the following command:\n   ```\n   git push -u origin master\n   ```\n\n8. Now, your project is connected to Git version control. You can use Git commands like `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` to manage your codebase.\n\n## Code Snippets and Commands\n- Initialize Git: `git init`\n- Add files to Git: `git add .`\n- Commit changes: `git commit -m \"Commit message\"`\n- Add remote repository: `git remote add origin <remote_repository_url>`\n- Push changes to remote repository: `git push -u origin master`\n\n## Troubleshooting and Common Issues\n- If you encounter an error while pushing to the remote repository, make sure you have the correct remote repository URL and proper access rights.\n- If you accidentally commit sensitive information, you can use the `git filter-branch` command to remove the sensitive data from the Git history.\n\n## Best Practices and Recommendations\n- Commit frequently: Make small, logical commits to track your changes effectively.\n- Use meaningful commit messages: Write descriptive commit messages that explain the purpose of the changes.\n- Branching: Create branches for new features or bug fixes to isolate your changes and enable collaboration.\n- Pull requests: Use pull requests to review and merge code changes from different branches.\n- Regularly update your local repository: Use `git pull` to fetch the latest changes from the remote repository.\n\n## Summary and Conclusion\nIntegrating Git version control with Parcel bundler provides a powerful solution for managing your web application codebase. By following the step-by-step instructions in this documentation, you can effectively track changes, collaborate with other developers, and maintain a clean and organized code repository. Remember to follow best practices and recommendations for optimal code management."
