Cross browser compatibility is an important aspect of web development, as it ensures that the web application works correctly across different web browsers.\n\nThis documentation will guide you through the process of achieving cross browser compatibility using Parcel Bundler.\n\n### Objective and Scope\nThe objective of this documentation is to provide step-by-step instructions on how to achieve cross browser compatibility using Parcel Bundler. This documentation covers the necessary requirements and pre-requisites, as well as troubleshooting tips and best practices.\n\n### Requirements and Pre-requisites\nTo follow this documentation, you will need the following:\n\n- Node.js installed on your machine\n- Basic knowledge of JavaScript and web development\n- A web application built using Parcel Bundler\n\n### Step-by-Step Instructions\n1. Install Parcel Bundler by running the following command in your terminal:\n   ```\n   npm install -g parcel-bundler\n   ```\n\n2. Navigate to the root directory of your web application in the terminal.\n\n3. Create a new file named `.browserslistrc` in the root directory of your web application.\n\n4. Open the `.browserslistrc` file and add the browsers you want to support. For example, to support the latest 2 versions of all major browsers, you can add the following:\n   ```\n   last 2 versions\n   ```\n\n5. Save the `.browserslistrc` file.\n\n6. Run the following command in the terminal to build your web application with cross browser compatibility:\n   ```\n   parcel build index.html\n   ```\n\n7.
