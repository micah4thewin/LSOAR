It is designed to be fast, easy to use, and highly efficient. One of the essential aspects of web development is handling images and fonts in a project. This documentation will guide you on how to handle images and fonts using Parcel Bundler.\n\n### Objective and Scope\nThe objective of this documentation is to provide step-by-step instructions on how to handle images and fonts in a web project using Parcel Bundler. The scope of this documentation covers the basic setup and configuration required to handle images and fonts, as well as best practices and troubleshooting tips.\n\n### Requirements and Pre-requisites\nTo follow this documentation, you need to have the following requirements and pre-requisites:\n\n- Node.js installed on your machine\n- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript\n- Familiarity with the command line interface\n\n### Step-by-Step Instructions\n1. Install Parcel Bundler by running the following command in your project directory:\n   ```\n   npm install -g parcel-bundler\n   ```\n\n2. Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it using the command line interface.\n\n3. Initialize a new npm project by running the following command:\n   ```\n   npm init -y\n   ```\n\n4. Install the required dependencies for handling images and fonts:\n   ```\n   npm install parcel-plugin-static-files-copy --save-dev\n   ```\n\n5. Create a new `src` directory in your project directory. Inside the `src` directory, create an `index.html` file and a `styles` directory.\n\n6. In the `styles` directory, create a CSS file named `style.css`. Add the following code to the `style.css` file:\n   ```css\n   @font-face {\n     font-family: 'MyCustomFont';\n     src: url('../fonts/my-custom-font.ttf') format('truetype');\n   }\n\n   .my-image {\n     background-image: url('../images/my-image.jpg');\n   }\n   ```\n\n7. In the `index.html` file, add the following HTML code:\n   ```html\n   <!DOCTYPE html>\n   <html>\n     <head>\n       <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"./styles/style.css\">\n     </head>\n     <body>\n       <h1>Parcel Bundler - Handling Images and Fonts</h1>\n       <div class=\"my-image\"></div>\n       <p>This is a custom font.</p>\n     </body>\n   </html>\n   ```\n\n8. Create a new `fonts` directory in your project directory. Place your custom font file (`my-custom-font.ttf`) inside the `fonts` directory.\n\n9. Create a new `images` directory in your project directory. Place your image file (`my-image.jpg`) inside the `images` directory.\n\n10. Build and run your project using Parcel Bundler by running the following command:\n    ```\n    parcel src/index.html\n    ```\n\n11. Parcel Bundler will bundle your project and create a `dist` directory. Inside the `dist` directory, you will find the bundled files, including the images and fonts.\n\n### Code Snippets and Commands\n- Installing Parcel Bundler:\n  ```\n  npm install -g parcel-bundler\n  ```\n\n- Initializing a new npm project:\n  ```\n  npm init -y\n  ```\n\n- Installing dependencies for handling images and fonts:\n  ```\n  npm install parcel-plugin-static-files-copy --save-dev\n  ```\n\n- Running Parcel Bundler:\n  ```\n  parcel src/index.html\n  ```\n\n### Troubleshooting and Common Issues\n- If your images or fonts are not being copied to the `dist` directory, make sure you have the `parcel-plugin-static-files-copy` dependency installed and configured correctly in your `package.json` file.\n\n- Check the file paths in your CSS and HTML files to ensure they are correctly referencing the images and fonts directories.\n\n### Best Practices and Recommendations\n- Organize your images and fonts in separate directories to keep your project structure clean and maintainable.\n\n- Use relative file paths in your CSS and HTML files to ensure the images and fonts are correctly referenced when the project is bundled.\n\n- Optimize your images before adding them to your project to reduce file size and improve performance.\n\n### Summary and Conclusion\nHandling images and fonts in a web project using Parcel Bundler is a straightforward process. By following the step-by-step instructions provided in this documentation, you can easily configure Parcel to bundle and copy your images and fonts to the `dist` directory. Remember to follow best practices and recommendations to ensure optimal performance and maintainability of your project."
