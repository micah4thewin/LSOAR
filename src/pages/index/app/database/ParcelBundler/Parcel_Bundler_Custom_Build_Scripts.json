  "article": "## Parcel Bundler Custom Build Scripts\n\n### Introduction\nParcel is a web application bundler that is fast, zero-config, and supports various file types out of the box. While Parcel provides a convenient default build process, there are times when you may need to customize the build scripts to meet specific requirements. This documentation will guide you through the process of creating custom build scripts for Parcel bundler.\n\n### Objective and Scope\nThe objective of this documentation is to provide step-by-step instructions on how to create custom build scripts for Parcel bundler. It will cover the necessary requirements and pre-requisites, as well as provide code snippets and commands to help you implement your custom build scripts. Additionally, it will address common issues and provide best practices and recommendations for optimal performance.\n\n### Requirements and Pre-requisites\nBefore you begin creating custom build scripts for Parcel bundler, ensure that you have the following requirements and pre-requisites in place:\n\n- Node.js and npm installed on your system\n- Basic knowledge of JavaScript and build tools\n\n### Step-by-Step Instructions\nFollow the steps below to create custom build scripts for Parcel bundler:\n\n1. Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it in your terminal.\n2. Initialize a new npm project by running the following command:\n```shell\nnpm init -y\n```\n3. Install Parcel bundler as a development dependency by running the following command:\n```shell\nnpm install parcel-bundler --save-dev\n```\n4. Create a new file named `build.js` in the root directory of your project.\n5. Open `build.js` in a text editor and add the following code:\n```javascript\nconst Bundler = require('parcel-bundler');\nconst entryFile = './src/index.html'; // Replace with your entry file\n\nconst options = {\n  // Add your custom build options here\n};\n\n(async () => {\n  const bundler = new Bundler(entryFile, options);\n  await bundler.bundle();\n})();\n```\n6. Replace `./src/index.html` in the `entryFile` variable with the path to your entry file.\n7. Customize the `options` object with your desired build options. Refer to the Parcel documentation for available options.\n8. Save the `build.js` file.\n\n### Code Snippets and Commands\nHere are some relevant code snippets and commands that you may find useful when creating custom build scripts for Parcel bundler:\n\n- To build your project using the custom build script, run the following command:\n```shell\nnode build.js\n```\n- To add additional build options, such as minification or source maps, modify the `options` object in the `build.js` file.\n\n### Troubleshooting and Common Issues\nIf you encounter any issues while creating or running your custom build scripts for Parcel bundler, consider the following troubleshooting steps:\n\n- Ensure that you have installed Parcel bundler as a development dependency.\n- Double-check the path to your entry file in the `entryFile` variable.\n- Verify that your custom build options are correctly defined in the `options` object.\n\n### Best Practices and Recommendations\nTo ensure optimal performance and security when creating custom build scripts for Parcel bundler, consider the following best practices and recommendations:\n\n- Minify your code to reduce file size and improve loading times.\n- Utilize source maps for easier debugging in development environments.\n- Separate your development and production build scripts to optimize the build process.\n\n### Summary and Conclusion\nCreating custom build scripts for Parcel bundler allows you to tailor the build process to your specific needs. By following the step-by-step instructions provided in this documentation, you should be able to create and run your own custom build scripts successfully. Remember to refer to the Parcel documentation for more advanced options and features."
