It is known for its zero-configuration setup and fast build times. In this documentation, we will explore how to use proxies with Parcel for development purposes.\n\n### Objective and Scope\nThe objective of this documentation is to guide developers on how to set up and use proxies with Parcel for local development. We will cover the necessary requirements, step-by-step instructions, code snippets, troubleshooting tips, and best practices.\n\n### Requirements and Pre-requisites\nTo follow along with this documentation, you will need the following:\n- Node.js and npm installed on your machine\n- Basic knowledge of JavaScript and web development concepts\n\n### Step-by-Step Instructions\n1. Start by creating a new project directory and navigate to it in your terminal.\n2. Initialize a new npm project by running the following command:\n   ```\n   npm init -y\n   ```\n3. Install Parcel as a dev dependency by running the following command:\n   ```\n   npm install parcel-bundler --save-dev\n   ```\n4. Create a new HTML file in your project directory, e.g., `index.html`, and add some basic HTML markup.\n5. Create a new JavaScript file in your project directory, e.g., `index.js`, and add some JavaScript code.\n6. Open the `package.json` file in your project directory and add the following script:\n   ```json\n   \"scripts\": {\n     \"start\": \"parcel index.html\"\n   }\n   ```\n7. Save the changes and close the `package.json` file.\n8. Start the development server by running the following command:\n   ```\n   npm start\n   ```\n9. Parcel will automatically bundle your files and start a development server at `http://localhost:1234`.\n10. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:1234` to view your application.\n\n### Code Snippets and Commands\n- Initializing a new npm project:\n  ```bash\n  npm init -y\n  ```\n\n- Installing Parcel as a dev dependency:\n  ```bash\n  npm install parcel-bundler --save-dev\n  ```\n\n- Starting the development server:\n  ```bash\n  npm start\n  ```\n\n### Troubleshooting and Common Issues\n- If you encounter any issues with Parcel not bundling or serving your files correctly, try deleting the `.cache` directory in your project directory and restarting the development server.\n\n### Best Practices and Recommendations\n- Use proxies to redirect API requests to a different server during development, allowing you to work with a backend API without CORS restrictions.\n- Make sure to handle proxy configurations securely and avoid exposing sensitive information in your development environment.\n\n### Summary and Conclusion\nIn this documentation, we explored how to use proxies with Parcel for development purposes. We covered the necessary requirements, step-by-step instructions, code snippets, troubleshooting tips, and best practices. By using proxies, you can easily redirect API requests during development and work with backend APIs without CORS restrictions. Happy coding!"
