  "article": "## Parcel Bundler Setup for Angular Projects\n\n### Introduction\nParcel is a web application bundler that helps simplify the process of bundling and building web applications. It is a zero-configuration bundler that automatically handles the dependencies and builds your application. This documentation will guide you through the process of setting up Parcel bundler for your Angular projects.\n\n### Objective and Scope\nThe objective of this documentation is to provide step-by-step instructions on setting up Parcel bundler for Angular projects. It covers the necessary requirements, pre-requisites, and provides code snippets and commands to help you easily configure Parcel for your Angular projects.\n\n### Requirements and Pre-requisites\nBefore getting started with Parcel bundler setup for Angular projects, make sure you have the following requirements and pre-requisites in place:\n\n- Node.js and npm installed on your system.\n- An existing Angular project.\n\n### Step-by-Step Instructions\nFollow the steps below to set up Parcel bundler for your Angular project:\n\n1. Open your terminal or command prompt.\n2. Navigate to your Angular project directory.\n3. Install Parcel bundler globally by running the following command:\n   ```\n   npm install -g parcel-bundler\n   ```\n4. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:\n   ```\n   npm install parcel-plugin-angular --save-dev\n   ```\n5. Create a new file named `.parcelrc` in the root directory of your Angular project.\n6. Add the following configuration to the `.parcelrc` file:\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"extends\": \"@parcel/config-default\",\n     \"transforms\": {\n       \"*.component.html\": [\"parcel-transformer-ng-template\"],\n       \"*.component.css\": [\"parcel-transformer-sass\"]\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n7. Update the `scripts` section in your `package.json` file to include the Parcel build command:\n   ```json\n   \"scripts\": {\n     \"start\": \"ng serve\",\n     \"build\": \"parcel build src/index.html --out-dir dist\"\n   }\n   ```\n8. Run the Parcel build command by running the following command in your terminal:\n   ```\n   npm run build\n   ```\n9. Parcel will bundle your Angular project and output the build files in the `dist` directory.\n\n### Code Snippets and Commands\nHere are some relevant code snippets and commands for setting up Parcel bundler for Angular projects:\n\n- Installing Parcel bundler globally:\n  ```\n  npm install -g parcel-bundler\n  ```\n\n- Installing required dependencies:\n  ```\n  npm install parcel-plugin-angular --save-dev\n  ```\n\n- Parcel build command in `package.json`:\n  ```json\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"build\": \"parcel build src/index.html --out-dir dist\"\n  }\n  ```\n\n- Running the Parcel build command:\n  ```\n  npm run build\n  ```\n\n### Troubleshooting and Common Issues\nIf you encounter any issues during the Parcel bundler setup for your Angular project, here are some common troubleshooting steps:\n\n- Make sure you have the latest version of Node.js and npm installed.\n- Double-check your configuration files for any errors or typos.\n- Clear the cache by running `npm cache clean --force` and try again.\n- Check the official Parcel documentation for any known issues or updates.\n\n### Best Practices and Recommendations\nHere are some best practices and recommendations for using Parcel bundler with Angular projects:\n\n- Keep your Angular project structure organized and modular.\n- Utilize lazy loading to improve performance.\n- Minify and optimize your code for production builds.\n- Regularly update your dependencies to ensure compatibility and security.\n\n### Summary and Conclusion\nSetting up Parcel bundler for your Angular projects can greatly simplify the build process and improve development efficiency. This documentation provided step-by-step instructions, code snippets, and troubleshooting tips to help you successfully configure Parcel bundler for your Angular projects. By following the recommended best practices, you can optimize your Angular application and deliver a better user experience."
