  "article": "## Java Functional Interface and Streams\n\n### Introduction\nJava Functional Interface and Streams are two powerful features introduced in Java 8 that allow developers to write more concise and expressive code. Functional interfaces provide a way to define a single abstract method, which can be implemented using lambda expressions or method references. Streams, on the other hand, provide a way to perform operations on a collection of data in a declarative and functional manner.\n\nThis documentation aims to provide a comprehensive overview of Java Functional Interface and Streams, including their purpose, usage, and best practices.\n\n### Objective and Scope\nThe objective of this documentation is to explain the concepts of Java Functional Interface and Streams and demonstrate their usage through practical examples. The scope of this documentation includes an introduction to functional interfaces, an explanation of streams and their operations, and guidelines for using them effectively.\n\n### Requirements and Pre-requisites\nTo follow along with the examples in this documentation, you will need:\n- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later installed on your machine\n- A code editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA\n\n### Step-by-Step Instructions\n1. Start by creating a new Java project in your preferred IDE.\n2. Create a new Java class and name it `FunctionalInterfaceExample`.\n3. Add the following code to the `FunctionalInterfaceExample` class:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.function.Function;\n\npublic class FunctionalInterfaceExample {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        // Example 1: Using a functional interface with a lambda expression\n        Function<Integer, String> convertToString = (num) -> Integer.toString(num);\n        String strNum = convertToString.apply(123);\n        System.out.println(\"Converted number: \" + strNum);\n\n        // Example 2: Using a functional interface with a method reference\n        Function<String, Integer> convertToInt = Integer::parseInt;\n        int num = convertToInt.apply(\"456\");\n        System.out.println(\"Converted number: \" + num);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n4. Save the file and run the `FunctionalInterfaceExample` class.\n5. You should see the following output:\n\n```\nConverted number: 123\nConverted number: 456\n```\n\n### Code Snippets and Commands\n- Functional Interface with Lambda Expression:\n```java\nFunction<Integer, String> convertToString = (num) -> Integer.toString(num);\nString strNum = convertToString.apply(123);\n```\n\n- Functional Interface with Method Reference:\n```java\nFunction<String, Integer> convertToInt = Integer::parseInt;\nint num = convertToInt.apply(\"456\");\n```\n\n### Troubleshooting and Common Issues\n- Make sure you have Java 8 or later installed on your machine. You can check your Java version by running `java -version` in the terminal.\n- Ensure that your IDE is configured to use the correct JDK version.\n- Check for any syntax errors or typos in your code.\n\n### Best Practices and Recommendations\n- Use functional interfaces when you need to define a single abstract method.\n- Take advantage of lambda expressions and method references to write more concise code.\n- Use streams for processing collections of data in a functional and declarative manner.\n- Avoid modifying the original data source when working with streams.\n\n### Summary and Conclusion\nJava Functional Interface and Streams are powerful features that enable developers to write more expressive and concise code. Functional interfaces allow for the implementation of a single abstract method using lambda expressions or method references. Streams provide a functional and declarative way to perform operations on collections of data. By understanding and utilizing these features effectively, developers can improve code readability and maintainability."
