These features aimed to improve developer productivity and code readability. This article will provide an overview of the new features in Java 8 and how they can be utilized.\n\n## Objective and Scope\nThe objective of this documentation is to familiarize developers with the new features introduced in Java 8 and provide guidance on their usage. The scope of this documentation will cover the key features and provide practical examples to demonstrate their functionality.\n\n## Requirements and Pre-requisites\nTo follow along with the examples in this documentation, you will need the following:\n\n- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later installed on your machine.\n- A basic understanding of the Java programming language.\n\n## Step-by-Step Instructions\n1. Install the Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later on your machine.\n2. Set up your development environment by configuring the JDK in your IDE or command line.\n3. Familiarize yourself with the new features introduced in Java 8 by reading the official documentation or online resources.\n4. Start implementing the new features in your code by following the provided examples and guidelines.\n\n## Code Snippets and Commands\nHere are some code snippets and commands that demonstrate the usage of the new features in Java 8:\n\n- Lambda Expressions:\n```java\nList<String> names = Arrays.asList(\"John\", \"Jane\", \"Bob\");\nnames.forEach(name -> System.out.println(name));\n```\n\n- Stream API:\n```java\nList<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);\nint sum = numbers.stream().filter(n -> n % 2 == 0).mapToInt(n -> n).sum();\nSystem.out.println(\"Sum of even numbers: \" + sum);\n```\n\n- Optional Class:\n```java\nOptional<String> name = Optional.ofNullable(getName());\nString result = name.orElse(\"Default Name\");\nSystem.out.println(\"Name: \" + result);\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting and Common Issues\n- If you encounter any compilation errors related to the new features, make sure you are using JDK 8 or later.\n- If you are experiencing unexpected behavior, verify that you are using the correct syntax and following the guidelines for each feature.\n\n## Best Practices and Recommendations\n- Familiarize yourself with the new features and their intended use cases before incorporating them into your code.\n- Use lambda expressions and the Stream API to simplify and streamline your code.\n- Take advantage of the Optional class to handle null values and avoid NullPointerExceptions.\n\n## Summary and Conclusion\nJava 8 introduced several new features that enhance developer productivity and code readability. By utilizing lambda expressions, the Stream API, and the Optional class, developers can write more concise and efficient code. This documentation provided an overview of these features and offered guidance on their usage."
