Two popular build tools in the Java ecosystem are Maven and Gradle. This documentation provides a comprehensive guide on how to use Maven and Gradle for building Java projects.\n\n### Objective and Scope\nThe objective of this documentation is to help developers understand the basics of Maven and Gradle and provide step-by-step instructions for using these build tools in Java projects. The scope of this documentation covers the installation, configuration, and usage of Maven and Gradle.\n\n### Requirements and Pre-requisites\nTo follow along with this documentation, you will need the following:\n- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system\n- Basic knowledge of Java programming language\n- Familiarity with the command line interface\n\n### Step-by-Step Instructions\n1. [Installing Maven](#installing-maven)\n2. [Configuring Maven](#configuring-maven)\n3. [Creating a Maven Project](#creating-a-maven-project)\n4. [Building and Running a Maven Project](#building-and-running-a-maven-project)\n5. [Installing Gradle](#installing-gradle)\n6. [Configuring Gradle](#configuring-gradle)\n7. [Creating a Gradle Project](#creating-a-gradle-project)\n8. [Building and Running a Gradle Project](#building-and-running-a-gradle-project)\n\n### Code Snippets and Commands\nHere are some useful code snippets and commands for working with Maven and Gradle:\n\n- Maven:\n  ```xml\n  <!-- pom.xml -->\n  <project>\n    <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>\n    <groupId>com.example</groupId>\n    <artifactId>my-project</artifactId>\n    <version>1.0.0</version>\n    <dependencies>\n      <!-- Add dependencies here -->\n    </dependencies>\n    <build>\n      <plugins>\n        <!-- Add plugins here -->\n      </plugins>\n    </build>\n  </project>\n  ```\n\n- Gradle:\n  ```groovy\n  // build.gradle\n  plugins {\n    // Add plugins here\n  }\n  \n  dependencies {\n    // Add dependencies here\n  }\n  \n  tasks {\n    // Define tasks here\n  }\n  ```\n\n- Maven command to build a project:\n  ```\n  mvn clean install\n  ```\n\n- Gradle command to build a project:\n  ```\n  gradle build\n  ```\n\n### Troubleshooting and Common Issues\n- **Maven**: If Maven is not recognized as a command, make sure it is added to the system's PATH environment variable.\n- **Gradle**: If Gradle is not recognized as a command, make sure it is added to the system's PATH environment variable.\n\n### Best Practices and Recommendations\n- Use a consistent directory structure for your Maven and Gradle projects.\n- Follow the best practices for managing dependencies and plugins in Maven and Gradle.\n- Regularly update your build tools to the latest versions to take advantage of new features and bug fixes.\n\n### Summary and Conclusion\nMaven and Gradle are powerful build tools that simplify the build process of Java projects. This documentation has provided an overview of Maven and Gradle, step-by-step instructions for using them, and tips for troubleshooting and best practices. By following this guide, you should be able to effectively build and manage your Java projects using Maven and Gradle."
