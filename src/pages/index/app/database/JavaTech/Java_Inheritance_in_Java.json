In Java, inheritance is implemented using the `extends` keyword. This documentation will provide a detailed explanation of Java inheritance and how to use it effectively in your programs.\n\n## Objective and Scope\n\nThe objective of this documentation is to provide a clear understanding of Java inheritance and its usage. It will cover the basic concepts of inheritance, including superclass and subclass, inheritance hierarchy, and access modifiers. It will also provide step-by-step instructions on how to implement inheritance in Java programs.\n\nThe scope of this documentation is limited to Java inheritance and does not cover other advanced topics such as interfaces or multiple inheritance.\n\n## Requirements and Pre-requisites\n\nTo follow along with the examples in this documentation, you will need:\n\n- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your computer\n- A text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA\n\n## Step-by-Step Instructions\n\n1. Create a new Java file for your superclass. This file should contain the common properties and behaviors that you want to inherit in your subclasses. For example, if you are creating a program to model different types of vehicles, you can create a `Vehicle` class with properties like `brand`, `model`, and `year`.\n\n2. Define the properties and behaviors of your superclass using instance variables and methods. For example:\n\n   ```java\n   public class Vehicle {\n       private String brand;\n       private String model;\n       private int year;\n\n       public Vehicle(String brand, String model, int year) {\n           this.brand = brand;\n           this.model = model;\n           this.year = year;\n       }\n\n       public void start() {\n           System.out.println(\"The vehicle is starting.\");\n       }\n\n       // Other methods...\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. Create a new Java file for your subclass. This file should extend the superclass using the `extends` keyword. For example, if you want to create a `Car` subclass, you can create a `Car` class that extends the `Vehicle` class.\n\n4. Define the additional properties and behaviors specific to your subclass. For example, if you want to add a `numDoors` property to your `Car` subclass, you can define it in the `Car` class:\n\n   ```java\n   public class Car extends Vehicle {\n       private int numDoors;\n\n       public Car(String brand, String model, int year, int numDoors) {\n           super(brand, model, year);\n           this.numDoors = numDoors;\n       }\n\n       public void drive() {\n           System.out.println(\"The car is driving.\");\n       }\n\n       // Other methods...\n   }\n   ```\n\n5. Use the inherited properties and behaviors in your subclass. You can access the superclass properties and methods using the `super` keyword. For example, in the `Car` class, you can call the `start()` method from the `Vehicle` class:\n\n   ```java\n   public void startCar() {\n       super.start();\n   }\n   ```\n\n6. Create objects of your subclass and test the inherited properties and behaviors. For example:\n\n   ```java\n   public static void main(String[] args) {\n       Car myCar = new Car(\"Toyota\", \"Camry\", 2021, 4);\n       myCar.start(); // Call the inherited method from the superclass\n       myCar.drive(); // Call the method specific to the subclass\n   }\n   ```\n\n## Code Snippets and Commands\n\nHere are some code snippets and commands related to Java inheritance:\n\n- Creating a subclass that extends a superclass:\n\n  ```java\n  public class Subclass extends Superclass {\n      // Class definition\n  }\n  ```\n\n- Accessing superclass properties and methods in a subclass:\n\n  ```java\n  public void myMethod() {\n      super.myMethod(); // Call the superclass method\n      // Other code\n  }\n  ```\n\n- Creating an object of a subclass:\n\n  ```java\n  Subclass myObject = new Subclass();\n  ```\n\n## Troubleshooting and Common Issues\n\n- Make sure you have correctly defined the superclass and subclass relationship using the `extends` keyword.\n- Check that you are using the correct access modifiers for your superclass properties and methods to ensure proper inheritance.\n- If you encounter any errors or issues, review your code for syntax errors or consult the Java documentation or online resources for assistance.\n\n## Best Practices and Recommendations\n\n- Use inheritance when you have classes that share common properties and behaviors to avoid code duplication.\n- Design your superclass and subclass relationship carefully to ensure proper encapsulation and maintainability.\n- Follow the Java naming conventions for classes, variables, and methods to improve code readability and maintainability.\n\n## Summary and Conclusion\n\nInheritance is a fundamental concept in Java that allows classes to inherit properties and behaviors from other classes. This documentation provided an overview of Java inheritance and step-by-step instructions on how to implement it in your programs. By using inheritance effectively, you can create more modular and maintainable code in your Java projects."
