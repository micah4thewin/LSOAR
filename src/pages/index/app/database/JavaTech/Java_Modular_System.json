  "article": "## Java Modular System\n\n### Introduction\nThe Java Modular System is a feature introduced in Java 9 that allows developers to create modular applications. It provides a way to divide large applications into smaller, more manageable modules, improving code organization and reusability.\n\n### Objective and Scope\nThe objective of this documentation is to provide a comprehensive guide on how to utilize the Java Modular System effectively. It covers the requirements, step-by-step instructions, code snippets, troubleshooting tips, and best practices for creating modular applications in Java.\n\n### Requirements and Pre-requisites\nTo use the Java Modular System, you need the following:\n\n- Java Development Kit (JDK) 9 or higher installed\n- Basic knowledge of Java programming\n- An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA (optional but recommended)\n\n### Step-by-Step Instructions\n1. **Create a Modular Java Project**: Start by creating a new Java project in your IDE. Choose the option to create a modular project if available.\n\n2. **Define a Module**: In your project, create a new module by creating a new directory with the module name. Inside the module directory, create a `module-info.java` file. This file defines the module and its dependencies. Use the `module` keyword followed by the module name and a list of required modules.\n\n   Example:\n   ```java\n   module com.example.mymodule {\n       requires java.base;\n       requires com.example.dependencymodule;\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **Create Package and Classes**: Inside the module directory, create packages and classes as usual. Each class should be in its respective package.\n\n4. **Export Packages**: To make packages accessible to other modules, you need to specify which packages are exported. Add the `exports` keyword followed by the package name in the `module-info.java` file.\n\n   Example:\n   ```java\n   module com.example.mymodule {\n       requires java.base;\n       requires com.example.dependencymodule;\n       exports com.example.mymodule.package1;\n       exports com.example.mymodule.package2;\n   }\n   ```\n\n5. **Compile and Run**: Compile your module using the `javac` command or your IDE's build feature. Run your modular application using the `java` command or your IDE's run feature.\n\n### Code Snippets and Commands\n- To compile a modular Java project:\n  ```\n  javac -d <output-directory> --module-source-path <source-directory> <module-name>\n  ```\n\n- To run a modular Java application:\n  ```\n  java --module-path <module-path> --module <module-name>/<main-class>\n  ```\n\n### Troubleshooting and Common Issues\n- **Error: module not found**: Make sure you have specified the correct module name and its dependencies in the `module-info.java` file.\n\n- **Error: package not found**: Check if the package is correctly exported in the `module-info.java` file.\n\n### Best Practices and Recommendations\n- Keep modules small and focused on a specific functionality or feature.\n- Use proper encapsulation to hide implementation details from other modules.\n- Avoid circular dependencies between modules.\n- Follow naming conventions for modules, packages, and classes.\n- Regularly review and update module dependencies to ensure compatibility.\n\n### Summary and Conclusion\nThe Java Modular System offers a powerful way to organize and manage large-scale Java applications. By dividing applications into smaller, more manageable modules, developers can improve code reusability, maintainability, and scalability. This documentation has provided a comprehensive guide on how to utilize the Java Modular System effectively, covering the requirements, step-by-step instructions, code snippets, troubleshooting tips, and best practices. With this knowledge, you can start creating modular applications in Java and take advantage of the benefits it offers."
