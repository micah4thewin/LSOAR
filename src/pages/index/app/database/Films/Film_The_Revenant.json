Directed by Alejandro González Iñárritu, the film is based on the true story of Hugh Glass, a fur trapper who survives a bear attack and seeks revenge on those who left him for dead. The Revenant is known for its breathtaking cinematography, intense performances, and exploration of themes such as survival, revenge, and the indomitable human spirit.\n\n## Synopsis\nIn the early 19th century, a group of fur trappers, led by Captain Andrew Henry, is attacked by Arikara Native Americans while searching for pelts along the Missouri River. Hugh Glass, a skilled tracker, serves as their guide. After the attack, the surviving members of the group, including Glass, attempt to make their way back to the nearest fort.\n\nDuring the journey, Glass is viciously mauled by a grizzly bear while scouting for food. Severely injured, he is left in the care of John Fitzgerald, a fellow trapper, and Jim Bridger, a young recruit. Fitzgerald, motivated by his own self-interest, kills Glass's half-Native American son and leaves Glass for dead, convincing Bridger to abandon him.\n\nDespite his injuries, Glass survives and embarks on a treacherous journey of revenge. He navigates through harsh winter landscapes, encounters hostile Native American tribes, and faces numerous physical and emotional challenges. Along the way, he forms a bond with a Native American named Hikuc, who helps him in his quest for vengeance.\n\n## Cast and Characters\n- Leonardo DiCaprio as Hugh Glass\n- Tom Hardy as John Fitzgerald\n- Domhnall Gleeson as Captain Andrew Henry\n- Will Poulter as Jim Bridger\n- Forrest Goodluck as Hawk (Hugh Glass's son)\n- Arthur RedCloud as Hikuc\n\n## Director and Crew\n- Director: Alejandro González Iñárritu\n- Screenplay: Mark L.
