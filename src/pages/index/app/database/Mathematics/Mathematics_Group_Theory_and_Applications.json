A group consists of a set of elements along with an operation that combines any two elements to produce a third element. Group theory has applications in various fields such as physics, chemistry, cryptography, and computer science.\n\n## Key Concepts\n- **Group**: A group is a set G together with an operation * that satisfies four properties: closure, associativity, identity element, and inverse element.\n- **Closure**: For any two elements a and b in G, the result of the operation a * b is also in G.\n- **Associativity**: For any three elements a, b, and c in G, the operation is associative: (a * b) * c = a * (b * c).\n- **Identity Element**: There exists an element e in G such that for any element a in G, the operation a * e = e * a = a.\n- **Inverse Element**: For any element a in G, there exists an element b in G such that a * b = b * a = e, where e is the identity element.\n\n## Theorems and Proofs\n- **Lagrange's Theorem**: If G is a finite group and H is a subgroup of G, then the order of H divides the order of G.\n- **Cayley's Theorem**: Every group G is isomorphic to a subgroup of the symmetric group on G.\n- **First Isomorphism Theorem**: If φ: G → H is a group homomorphism with kernel K, then the quotient group G/K is isomorphic to the image of φ.\n- **Second Isomorphism Theorem**: If H and N are subgroups of a group G, with N normal in G, then HN is a subgroup of G, H ∩ N is a normal subgroup of H, and H/(H ∩ N) is isomorphic to HN/N.\n- **Third Isomorphism Theorem**: If N and K are normal subgroups of a group G, with N contained in K, then (G/N)/(K/N) is isomorphic to G/K.\n- **Homomorphism Theorem**: If φ: G → H is a group homomorphism with kernel K, then there exists a unique group homomorphism ψ: G/K → H such that φ = ψ ∘ π, where π is the canonical projection from G to G/K.\n\n## Example Problems\n1. Let G be the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and * be the operation of addition modulo 5. Show that (G, *) forms a group.\n```markdown\nGiven G = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and * as addition modulo 5, we need to show that (G, *) satisfies the properties of a group.\n\n1. Closure: For any two elements a and b in G, a * b should also be in G. Let's check:\n   1 * 2 = 3 (mod 5), which is in G.\n   4 * 5 = 4 (mod 5), which is in G.\n   Therefore, closure holds.\n\n2. Associativity: For any three elements a, b, and c in G, (a * b) * c should be equal to a * (b * c). Let's check:\n   (1 * 2) * 3 = 3 * 3 = 1 (mod 5)\n   1 * (2 * 3) = 1 * 0 = 1 (mod 5)\n   Therefore, associativity holds.\n\n3. Identity Element: There exists an element e in G such that for any element a in G, a * e = e * a = a. Let's check:\n   1 * 4 = 4 * 1 = 1 (mod 5)\n   2 * 4 = 4 * 2 = 2 (mod 5)\n   Therefore, the identity element is 4.\n\n4. Inverse Element: For any element a in G, there exists an element b in G such that a * b = b * a = e. Let's check:\n   1 * 1 = 1 * 1 = 4 (mod 5)\n   2 * 3 = 3 * 2 = 4 (mod 5)\n   Therefore, the inverse element exists for each element.\n\nSince (G, *) satisfies all the properties, it forms a group.\n```\n2. Prove that the order of any subgroup of a finite group divides the order of the group.\n```markdown\nLet G be a finite group and H be a subgroup of G. We need to prove that the order of H divides the order of G.\n\nBy Lagrange's Theorem, the order of a subgroup H is defined as the number of elements in H. Let |H| represent the order of H and |G| represent the order of G.\n\nSince H is a subgroup of G, every element in H is also an element of G. Therefore, |H| ≤ |G|.\n\nBy dividing |G| by |H|, we can write |G| = k * |H| + r, where k is an integer and 0 ≤ r < |H|.\n\nNow, consider the left cosets of H in G. Each left coset has |H| elements, and since there are k left cosets, the total number of elements is k * |H|. Thus, r elements remain in G.\n\nHowever, since r < |H|, these r elements cannot form a complete left coset. Therefore, they must belong to one of the k left cosets.\n\nThis implies that the elements in the remaining r elements form a subset of H. Since H is closed under the group operation, the product of any two elements in H is also in H. Therefore, H contains all the elements in the remaining r elements.\n\nHence, |G| = k * |H| + r implies that |H| divides |G|.\n\nTherefore, the order of any subgroup of a finite group divides the order of the group.\n```\n\n## Applications\n- Group theory has applications in cryptography, where groups are used to create secure encryption algorithms.\n- In physics, group theory is used to study the symmetries of physical systems, such as particle physics and quantum mechanics.\n- Group theory is applied in chemistry to understand the symmetry properties of molecules and their behavior.\n- Computer science utilizes group theory in areas like data compression, error correction codes, and algorithm design.\n\n## Historical Context\nGroup theory was first introduced by the French mathematician Évariste Gal"
