It combines mathematical theory, computer science, and numerical analysis to provide solutions to various mathematical problems that are difficult or impossible to solve analytically.\n\n## Key Concepts\n1. Algorithms: Computational mathematics heavily relies on algorithms, which are step-by-step procedures or instructions for solving a specific problem. These algorithms can be used to perform calculations, optimize processes, simulate mathematical models, and more.\n\n2. Numerical Methods: Numerical methods involve approximating solutions to mathematical problems using numerical techniques. These methods often involve breaking down complex problems into simpler, more manageable steps and using iterative processes to converge towards an accurate solution.\n\n3. Optimization: Computational mathematics plays a crucial role in optimization problems, where the goal is to find the best possible solution among a set of alternatives. Optimization algorithms are used to maximize or minimize objective functions, subject to certain constraints.\n\n4. Simulation: Simulation involves using computational methods to model and replicate real-world systems or phenomena. Computational mathematics enables the simulation of physical, biological, economic, and other systems, providing insights and predictions that may not be feasible through analytical methods alone.\n\n5. Data Analysis: Computational mathematics is essential for analyzing and interpreting large datasets. It involves developing algorithms and statistical methods to extract meaningful information from data, identify patterns, make predictions, and support decision-making processes.\n\n## Theorems and Proofs\nWhile computational mathematics focuses more on algorithms and numerical methods rather than theoretical proofs, there are several theorems that underpin the field. Here are a few notable ones:\n\n1. **Bisection Method**: The bisection method is a numerical method used to find the root of a function. It relies on the Intermediate Value Theorem, which states that if a continuous function takes on two values, one positive and one negative, within an interval, then it must have at least one root within that interval.\n\n2. **Euler's Method**: Euler's method is a numerical method for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs). It is based on the Taylor series expansion of a function and approximates the solution by taking small steps along the tangent line at each point.\n\n3. **Gaussian Elimination**: Gaussian elimination is an algorithm used to solve systems of linear equations. It involves transforming the system into row-echelon form by performing elementary row operations, such as adding multiples of one equation to another. The solution can then be obtained by back-substitution.\n\n## Example Problems\n1. Find the root of the equation f(x) = x^3 - 2x - 5 using the bisection method.\n\n```python\ndef bisection_method(f, a, b, tolerance):\n    while abs(b - a) > tolerance:\n        c = (a + b) / 2\n        if f(c) == 0:\n            return c\n        elif f(a) * f(c) < 0:\n            b = c\n        else:\n            a = c\n    return (a + b) / 2\n\ndef f(x):\n    return x**3 - 2*x - 5\n\nroot = bisection_method(f, 2, 3, 0.001)\nprint(root)\n```\n\n2. Solve the following system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination:\n\n```\n2x + 3y - z = 5\nx - y + 2z = 3\n3x + 2y + z = 1\n```\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nA = np.array([[2, 3, -1], [1, -1, 2], [3, 2, 1]])\nb = np.array([5, 3, 1])\n\nx = np.linalg.solve(A, b)\nprint(x)\n```\n\n## Applications\nComputational mathematics has numerous applications across various fields, including:\n\n- Engineering: Computational mathematics is used in engineering disciplines to simulate physical systems, optimize designs, analyze structures, and solve complex equations.\n\n- Finance: Computational mathematics plays a crucial role in financial modeling, risk assessment, option pricing, portfolio optimization, and algorithmic trading.\n\n- Physics: Computational mathematics is used to simulate physical phenomena, solve differential equations, model particle interactions, and analyze complex systems in physics.\n\n- Biology: Computational mathematics is used in bioinformatics, genomics, modeling biological systems, simulating population dynamics, and analyzing biological data.\n\n- Computer Science: Computational mathematics is the foundation of computer algorithms, cryptography, data compression, computer graphics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.\n\n## Historical Context\nComputational mathematics has its roots in ancient civilizations, where early mathematical techniques were used to solve practical problems.
