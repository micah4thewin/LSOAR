They are created through a process called iteration, where a simple geometric shape is repeated multiple times with slight modifications. Fractals can be found in various natural and mathematical phenomena, such as the branching patterns of trees, the coastline of a country, or the Mandelbrot set.\n\n### Key Concepts\n1. Self-Similarity: Fractals exhibit self-similarity, which means that they have the same pattern at different scales. This property allows us to zoom in on a fractal and see similar shapes repeating infinitely. For example, the Mandelbrot set has intricate patterns that look similar no matter how much we zoom in.\n\n2. Iteration: Fractals are created through an iterative process. Starting with a basic shape, we repeat a set of instructions multiple times, modifying the shape slightly each time. This repetition creates intricate patterns and self-similarity. For example, the Sierpinski triangle is created by dividing an equilateral triangle into smaller triangles and removing the middle one. This process is repeated on the remaining triangles, creating a fractal pattern.\n\n3. Fractal Dimension: Fractals have a fractional or non-integer dimension, which means they occupy a fractional amount of space. Unlike regular geometric shapes with integer dimensions (e.g., a line has dimension 1, a square has dimension 2), fractals can have dimensions like 1.58 or 2.73. This property is a result of their self-similarity and infinite complexity.\n\n### Theorems and Proofs\n1. Hausdorff Dimension: The Hausdorff dimension is a measure of the \"size\" of a fractal. It is defined as the smallest number D such that the fractal can be covered by a set of balls of radius r, where the number of balls needed is proportional to r^(-D). For example, the Hausdorff dimension of the Sierpinski triangle is log(3)/log(2) â‰ˆ 1.585.\n\n2. Mandelbrot Set: The Mandelbrot set is a famous fractal that is generated by iterating a complex function. The set is defined as the set of complex numbers c for which the iteration of the function z(n+1) = z(n)^2 + c remains bounded. The boundary of the Mandelbrot set exhibits intricate fractal patterns.\n\n### Example Problems\n1. Generate the Sierpinski triangle using iteration:\n```python\ndef sierpinski(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return [[1]]\n    else:\n        smaller = sierpinski(n-1)\n        size = len(smaller)\n        upper = [[0]*size for _ in range(size)]\n        lower = [[0]*size for _ in range(size)]\n        middle = [[1]*size for _ in range(size)]\n        return upper + smaller + lower + middle\n\n# Test the function\nsierpinski(3)\n```\nOutput:\n```\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0,"
