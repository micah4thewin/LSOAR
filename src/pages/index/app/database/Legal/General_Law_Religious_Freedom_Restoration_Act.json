It was enacted to ensure that the government does not substantially burden a person's exercise of religion unless it can demonstrate a compelling interest and use the least restrictive means to achieve that interest.\n\n## Overview of General Law Religious Freedom Restoration Act Laws\nThe RFRA was first passed by Congress in 1993 in response to a Supreme Court decision that limited the protection of religious freedom under the First Amendment. Since then, many states have also enacted their own versions of the RFRA, providing additional protections at the state level.\n\nThe RFRA applies to all federal laws and regulations, as well as state and local laws that receive federal funding or involve interstate commerce. It provides individuals and entities with a defense against government actions that substantially burden their exercise of religion.\n\n## Key Legal Concepts\nThere are several key legal concepts associated with the General Law Religious Freedom Restoration Act:\n\n1. Substantial Burden: The RFRA protects against government actions that impose a significant restriction or limitation on a person's religious beliefs or practices. A burden is considered substantial if it forces a person to choose between following their religious beliefs and complying with the law.\n\n2. Compelling Interest: For the government to justify a substantial burden on religious freedom, it must demonstrate a compelling interest. This means that the government must show that it has a compelling reason for imposing the burden and that it is necessary to achieve an important government objective.\n\n3. Least Restrictive Means: Even if the government has a compelling interest, it must use the least restrictive means to achieve that interest. This means that the government must demonstrate that there are no alternative measures that would impose a lesser burden on religious freedom while still achieving the government's objective.\n\n## Application and Enforcement\nThe RFRA provides individuals and entities with a defense against government actions that substantially burden their exercise of religion. If a person or entity believes that their religious freedom has been violated, they can assert their rights under the RFRA in court.\n\nWhen a claim is brought under the RFRA, the court will apply a two-step analysis. First, the court will determine whether the government action in question substantially burdens the person's exercise of religion. If the court finds a substantial burden, it will then proceed to the second step and assess whether the government has a compelling interest and has used the least restrictive means to achieve that interest.\n\nIf the court determines that the government has not met its burden, it may grant the individual or entity relief, such as an exemption from the law or regulation in question.\n\n## Notable Legal Cases\nSeveral notable legal cases have involved the General Law Religious Freedom Restoration Act:\n\n1. Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. (2014): The Supreme Court held that closely held corporations could assert religious objections to the contraceptive coverage requirement of the Affordable Care Act under the RFRA.\n\n2. Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission (2018): The Supreme Court ruled in favor of a baker who refused to create a wedding cake for a same-sex couple, finding that the Colorado Civil Rights Commission violated the baker's rights under the RFRA.\n\n3. Holt v. Hobbs (2015): The Supreme Court held that an Arkansas prison policy prohibiting a Muslim inmate from growing a half-inch beard violated the inmate's rights under the RFRA.\n\nThese cases highlight the significant impact of the RFRA on the protection of religious freedom in various contexts.\n\n## Detailed Explanation\nFor a more comprehensive and advanced understanding of the General Law Religious Freedom Restoration Act, it is essential to consult legal resources, such as legal textbooks, scholarly articles, and court opinions. These sources provide in-depth analysis and detailed explanations of the RFRA's history, interpretation, and application in different legal scenarios."
