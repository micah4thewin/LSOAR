These small, red-orange berries are known for their high vitamin C content and have been used for centuries for their medicinal and nutritional benefits.\n\n## Plant Overview\nWild Rose Hips come from various species of wild roses, including Rosa rugosa and Rosa canina. These plants are deciduous shrubs that can reach a height of 6 to 10 feet. They have thorny branches and produce fragrant, pink or white flowers in the spring.

These properties contribute to the plant's medicinal and nutritional benefits.\n\n## Traditional and Medicinal Uses\n- Boosting Immunity: Wild Rose Hips have long been used as a natural remedy for boosting the immune system.
