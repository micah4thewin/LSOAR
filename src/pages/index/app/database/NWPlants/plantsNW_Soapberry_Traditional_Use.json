The saponins in soapberry are believed to repel insects and pests.\n\n## Nutritional Benefits\n\nWhile soapberry is primarily valued for its cleansing properties, it also offers some nutritional benefits. Soapberries are a good source of antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals. They contain vitamin C, iron, and calcium, which contribute to overall health and well-being.\n\n## Practical Tips for Use\n\nTo use soapberry, you can either purchase soapberry products or prepare your own soap solution.
