Also known as Oregon oxalis or woodsorrel, this plant is known for its heart-shaped leaves and delicate white or pink flowers. While it is primarily valued for its ornamental qualities, redwood sorrel also has a range of medicinal, nutritional, and traditional uses.\n\n## Plant Overview\nRedwood sorrel is a low-growing perennial plant that typically reaches a height of 6 to 12 inches.

However, it is important to note that excessive consumption of oxalic acid can be harmful to individuals with certain health conditions, such as kidney problems or a history of kidney stones. It is always advisable to consult a healthcare professional before using redwood sorrel for medicinal purposes.\n\n## Nutritional Benefits\nRedwood sorrel is a good source of vitamin C and other antioxidants.
