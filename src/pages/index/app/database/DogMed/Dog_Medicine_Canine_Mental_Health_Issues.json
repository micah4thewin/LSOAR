The focus has shifted from primarily treating physical ailments to encompassing a holistic approach that addresses both physical and mental health issues in dogs. Canine healthcare has seen trends such as preventive medicine, alternative therapies, and personalized treatment plans.\n\n## Essential Practices and Techniques\nTo provide effective veterinary care for dogs, several crucial practices and techniques are employed. These include routine check-ups, vaccinations, diagnostic tests, surgical procedures, dental care, nutrition counseling, and behavioral therapy. Each of these practices contributes to maintaining the overall health and well-being of dogs.\n\n## Prominent Veterinarians and Milestones\nThroughout history, several veterinarians have made significant contributions to the field of veterinary medicine for dogs. Dr. James Herriot, a renowned British veterinarian, once said, \"I hope to make people realize how totally helpless animals are, how dependent on us, trusting as a child must that we will be kind and take care of their needs.\" Milestones in the field include the development of anesthesia for animals, the discovery of antibiotics, and the establishment of veterinary schools.\n\n## Impact on Canine Health\nVeterinary medicine has had a profound impact on the health and longevity of dogs.
