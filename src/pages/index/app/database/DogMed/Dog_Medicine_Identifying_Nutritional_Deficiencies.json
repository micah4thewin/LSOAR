While many commercial diets are formulated to meet basic nutritional requirements, individual dogs may have specific needs that require additional attention. Another misconception is that supplements can replace a balanced diet. While supplements can be beneficial in certain cases, they should not be used as a substitute for a well-rounded diet.\n\n## Noteworthy Dog Health Facts\n- Dogs require a balanced diet that includes proteins, fats, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals.\n- Certain dog breeds may have specific nutritional requirements due to their genetic predispositions.\n- Puppies and senior dogs have different nutritional needs compared to adult dogs.\n- Nutritional deficiencies can lead to various health issues, including poor coat quality, weakened immune system, and growth abnormalities.\n\n## Summary and Key Takeaways\nVeterinary medicine plays a vital role in identifying and addressing nutritional deficiencies in dogs.
