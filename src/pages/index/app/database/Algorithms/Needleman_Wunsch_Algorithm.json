It provides an optimal alignment by assigning scores to different matches, mismatches, and gaps between the sequences. This algorithm has revolutionized the field by enabling researchers to compare and analyze genetic sequences, leading to significant advancements in understanding evolutionary relationships and identifying functional elements within genomes.\n\n## Background of the Algorithmic Topic\nThe Needleman-Wunsch algorithm was first introduced by Saul B. Needleman and Christian D. Wunsch in 1970. It was initially developed to solve the problem of sequence alignment, which involves finding the best possible alignment between two sequences of symbols. This algorithm laid the foundation for subsequent developments in sequence alignment algorithms and has become a fundamental tool in bioinformatics.\n\n## Essential Concepts and Techniques\nTo understand the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm, it is important to grasp a few key concepts and techniques:\n\n1. Dynamic Programming: The Needleman-Wunsch algorithm utilizes dynamic programming to solve the sequence alignment problem efficiently. It breaks down the problem into smaller subproblems and solves them iteratively, building up to the optimal solution.\n\n2. Scoring Scheme: The algorithm uses a scoring scheme to assign scores to different matches, mismatches, and gaps in the sequences. This scoring scheme determines the alignment that maximizes the score, representing the best possible alignment.\n\n3. Alignment Matrix: The algorithm constructs an alignment matrix to store the scores for each possible alignment of the sequences. This matrix is filled in a dynamic programming fashion, allowing the algorithm to efficiently compute the optimal alignment.\n\n4. Traceback: Once the alignment matrix is computed, the algorithm performs a traceback to determine the actual alignment. Starting from the bottom-right cell of the matrix, it traces back through the matrix, following the path that leads to the highest score.\n\n## Example\nHere's an example implementation of the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm in ES6 JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfunction needlemanWunsch(seq1, seq2, matchScore, mismatchScore, gapScore) {\n  const m = seq1.length;\n  const n = seq2.length;\n\n  // Initialize the alignment matrix\n  const matrix = Array.from({ length: m + 1 }, () => Array(n + 1).fill(0));\n\n  // Fill the first row and column with gap scores\n  for (let i = 1; i <= m; i++) {\n    matrix[i][0] = matrix[i - 1][0] + gapScore;\n  }\n  for (let j = 1; j <= n; j++) {\n    matrix[0][j] = matrix[0][j - 1] + gapScore;\n  }\n\n  // Fill the remaining cells of the matrix\n  for (let i = 1; i <= m; i++) {\n    for (let j = 1; j <= n; j++) {\n      const match = matrix[i - 1][j - 1] + (seq1[i - 1] === seq2[j - 1] ? matchScore : mismatchScore);\n      const gap1 = matrix[i - 1][j] + gapScore;\n      const gap2 = matrix[i][j - 1] + gapScore;\n\n      matrix[i][j] = Math.max(match, gap1, gap2);\n    }\n  }\n\n  // Perform traceback to determine the alignment\n  let alignment1 = '';\n  let alignment2 = '';\n  let i = m;\n  let j = n;\n\n  while (i > 0 && j > 0) {\n    if (matrix[i][j] === matrix[i - 1][j - 1] + (seq1[i - 1] === seq2[j - 1] ? matchScore : mismatchScore)) {\n      alignment1 = seq1[i - 1] + alignment1;\n      alignment2 = seq2[j - 1] + alignment2;\n      i--;\n      j--;\n    } else if (matrix[i][j] === matrix[i - 1][j] + gapScore) {\n      alignment1 = seq1[i - 1] + alignment1;\n      alignment2 = '-' + alignment2;\n      i--;\n    } else {\n      alignment1 = '-' + alignment1;\n      alignment2 = seq2[j - 1] + alignment2;\n      j--;\n    }\n  }\n\n  while (i > 0) {\n    alignment1 = seq1[i - 1] + alignment1;\n    alignment2 = '-' + alignment2;\n    i--;\n  }\n\n  while (j > 0) {\n    alignment1 = '-' + alignment1;\n    alignment2 = seq2[j - 1] + alignment2;\n    j--;\n  }\n\n  return [alignment1, alignment2];\n}\n\n// Example usage\nconst seq1 = 'ACGTCAG';\nconst seq2 = 'ACTGTCG';\nconst matchScore = 1;\nconst mismatchScore = -1;\nconst gapScore = -2;\n\nconst [alignment1, alignment2] = needlemanWunsch(seq1, seq2, matchScore, mismatchScore, gapScore);\nconsole.log(alignment1);\nconsole.log(alignment2);\n```\n\nIn this example, the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm is used to align two DNA sequences (`seq1` and `seq2`). The algorithm takes into account the match score, mismatch score, and gap score to compute the optimal alignment. The resulting alignments are then printed to the console.\n\n## Notable Contributors and Milestones\n-"
