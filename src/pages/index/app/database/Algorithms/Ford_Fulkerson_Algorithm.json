It is used to find the maximum flow in a flow network, which represents a system of interconnected nodes and edges with capacities. By determining the maximum amount of flow that can be sent from a source node to a sink node, this algorithm has numerous applications in transportation, communication, and resource allocation.\n\n## Background of the Algorithmic Topic\nThe Ford-Fulkerson algorithm was first introduced by L.R. Ford Jr. and D.R. Fulkerson in 1956. It was developed as a solution to the maximum flow problem, which seeks to optimize the flow of a resource through a network. The algorithm builds upon the concept of augmenting paths, which are paths in the network that can be used to increase the flow from the source to the sink.\n\n## Essential Concepts and Techniques\nTo understand the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm, it is crucial to grasp the following concepts and techniques:\n\n1. **Residual Graph**: The residual graph is a modified version of the original graph that represents the remaining capacity of each edge after some flow has been sent through it. It is used to find augmenting paths and determine the maximum flow.\n\n2. **Augmenting Paths**: An augmenting path is a path in the residual graph from the source to the sink that still has available capacity. By finding augmenting paths and increasing the flow along these paths, the algorithm iteratively improves the overall flow.\n\n3. **Capacity Scaling**: Capacity scaling is a technique used to optimize the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm. It involves starting with a large capacity and gradually reducing it until the maximum flow is found. This approach reduces the number of iterations required, improving the algorithm's efficiency.\n\n## Example\nHere is an example of implementing the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfunction fordFulkerson(graph, source, sink) {\n  // Initialize flow to 0\n  let flow = 0;\n\n  // Create residual graph\n  let residualGraph = createResidualGraph(graph);\n\n  // Find augmenting paths and update flow\n  let augmentingPath = findAugmentingPath(residualGraph, source, sink);\n  while (augmentingPath) {\n    let pathFlow = findPathFlow(residualGraph, augmentingPath);\n    updateFlow(graph, residualGraph, augmentingPath, pathFlow);\n    flow += pathFlow;\n    augmentingPath = findAugmentingPath(residualGraph, source, sink);\n  }\n\n  return flow;\n}\n\n// Helper functions\n// ...\n\n// Usage example\nlet graph = createGraph();\nlet source = graph.getNode(\"source\");\nlet sink = graph.getNode(\"sink\");\nlet maxFlow = fordFulkerson(graph, source, sink);\nconsole.log(\"Maximum flow:\", maxFlow);\n```\n\n## Notable Contributors and Milestones\nThe Ford-Fulkerson algorithm was developed by L.R.

Additional techniques, such as the Edmonds-Karp algorithm, are often used to find the optimal solution.\n\n2. **Efficiency**: The efficiency of the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm depends on the choice of augmenting paths.
