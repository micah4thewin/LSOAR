It is particularly useful in sequence alignment, which involves comparing DNA, RNA, or protein sequences to understand their evolutionary relationships and functional similarities. By finding the optimal alignment between two sequences, the algorithm can uncover regions of similarity, even in the presence of insertions, deletions, and substitutions.\n\n## Background of the Algorithmic Topic\nThe Smith-Waterman algorithm was developed by Temple F. Smith and Michael S. Waterman in 1981. It was an extension of the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm, which was the first algorithm for global sequence alignment. The Smith-Waterman algorithm introduced the concept of local alignment, allowing for more flexible and accurate comparisons between sequences.\n\n## Essential Concepts and Techniques\nThe Smith-Waterman algorithm is based on dynamic programming, a technique that breaks down a complex problem into smaller, overlapping subproblems. It uses a scoring system to assign values to matches, mismatches, insertions, and deletions. The algorithm builds a matrix to store the scores for all possible alignments and then traces back to find the optimal local alignment.\n\n## Example\nHere is an example of implementing the Smith-Waterman algorithm in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfunction smithWaterman(sequence1, sequence2) {\n  const matrix = [];\n  // Initialize the matrix with zeros\n  \n  // Calculate the scores for each cell in the matrix\n  \n  // Trace back to find the optimal alignment\n  \n  // Return the optimal alignment\n}\n\nconst sequence1 = \"ACGT\";\nconst sequence2 = \"AGT\";\nconst alignment = smithWaterman(sequence1, sequence2);\nconsole.log(alignment);\n```\n\n## Notable Contributors and Milestones\n- Temple F.
