Two of these elements are `<article>` and `<section>`. These elements provide a way to organize and structure content on a webpage.\n\n### Objective and Scope\nThe objective of this documentation is to explain the usage and benefits of the `<article>` and `<section>` elements in HTML5. It will cover the requirements, step-by-step instructions, code snippets, troubleshooting, best practices, and a summary of the key points.\n\n### Requirements and Pre-requisites\nTo use the `<article>` and `<section>` elements, you need a basic understanding of HTML5 and a text editor to write your HTML code.\n\n### Step-by-Step Instructions\n1. Open your preferred text editor.\n2. Create a new HTML file or open an existing one.\n3. Add the `<article>` element to define a self-contained composition within a document.\n   ```html\n   <article>\n       <h2>Article Title</h2>\n       <p>Article content goes here...</p>\n   </article>\n   ```\n4. Add the `<section>` element to define a section within a document.\n   ```html\n   <section>\n       <h3>Section Title</h3>\n       <p>Section content goes here...</p>\n   </section>\n   ```\n5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 to add more articles and sections as needed.\n\n### Code Snippets and Commands\n- Example of an `<article>` element:\n  ```html\n  <article>\n      <h2>Article Title</h2>\n      <p>Article content goes here...</p>\n  </article>\n  ```\n\n- Example of a `<section>` element:\n  ```html\n  <section>\n      <h3>Section Title</h3>\n      <p>Section content goes here...</p>\n  </section>\n  ```\n\n### Troubleshooting and Common Issues\n- Make sure you are using a modern browser that supports HTML5.\n- Check your HTML code for any syntax errors or missing closing tags.\n- If the styling does not appear as expected, check your CSS rules and selectors.\n\n### Best Practices and Recommendations\n- Use the `<article>` element for standalone content that can be distributed independently.\n- Use the `<section>` element to group related content within an `<article>` or the main document.\n- Avoid nesting `<article>` elements inside `<section>` elements, as it can lead to confusion.\n\n### Summary and Conclusion\nThe `<article>` and `<section>` elements in HTML5 provide a way to structure and organize content on a webpage. By using these elements correctly, you can improve the accessibility and readability of your web pages. Remember to follow best practices and recommendations to ensure optimal performance and maintainability of your code."
