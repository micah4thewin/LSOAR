HTML comments are a way to add notes or explanations within the HTML code. This documentation will provide an overview of HTML comments and best practices for using them effectively.\n\n### Objective and Scope\nThe objective of this documentation is to explain the purpose and usage of HTML comments in HTML5. It will also cover best practices and recommendations for using comments in a way that enhances code readability and maintainability.\n\n### Requirements and Pre-requisites\nTo follow along with the examples in this documentation, you will need a basic understanding of HTML5 and a text editor to write HTML code. No additional software or tools are required.\n\n### Step-by-Step Instructions\n1. Open your preferred text editor.\n2. Create a new HTML file with the .html extension.\n3. Add the following code to the HTML file:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n  <title>HTML Comments Example</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n  <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>\n  <!-- This is a comment -->\n  <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>\n  <!-- Another comment -->\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n4. Save the file with a .html extension.\n5. Open the HTML file in a web browser.\n6. Inspect the page source code by right-clicking on the page and selecting \"Inspect\" or \"View Page Source\".\n7. Locate the comments in the HTML code. They will be surrounded by `<!--` and `-->`.\n\n### Code Snippets and Commands\nThe following code snippet demonstrates the usage of HTML comments:\n\n```html\n<!-- This is a comment -->\n```\n\n### Troubleshooting and Common Issues\n- Make sure the comments are enclosed within `<!--` and `-->`. Comments outside these delimiters will be treated as regular text.\n- Comments should not be used to hide or disable code. Use proper HTML elements and attributes for that purpose.\n\n### Best Practices and Recommendations\n- Use comments to provide explanations or notes about your code. This can be helpful for other developers who need to understand or modify your code in the future.\n- Keep comments concise and to the point. Avoid unnecessary or excessive comments that can clutter the code.\n- Use comments to temporarily disable or \"comment out\" code during development. However, remember to remove or uncomment the code before deploying to production.\n- Avoid using comments as a substitute for clean and readable code. Write self-explanatory code whenever possible.\n\n### Summary and Conclusion\nHTML comments are a useful tool for adding notes and explanations within your HTML code. By following best practices and using comments judiciously, you can improve the readability and maintainability of your HTML code. Remember to keep comments concise and to the point, and use them as a supplement to clean and readable code."
