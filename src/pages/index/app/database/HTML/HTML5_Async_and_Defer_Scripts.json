These attributes allow scripts to be loaded and executed asynchronously, improving the performance and loading time of web pages.\n\n### Objective and Scope\nThe objective of this documentation is to provide a clear understanding of how to use the `async` and `defer` attributes in HTML5. The scope of this documentation covers the usage, benefits, and best practices of using these attributes.\n\n### Requirements and Pre-requisites\nTo utilize the `async` and `defer` attributes, you need:\n- A text editor to modify HTML files.\n- A web browser that supports HTML5.\n\n### Step-by-Step Instructions\n1. Open your HTML file in a text editor.\n2. Locate the `<script>` tag that includes the script you want to load asynchronously or defer.\n3. Add the `async` attribute to the `<script>` tag if you want the script to be executed asynchronously. For example:\n   ```html\n   <script src=\"script.js\" async></script>\n   ```\n4. Add the `defer` attribute to the `<script>` tag if you want the script to be executed after the HTML document has been parsed. For example:\n   ```html\n   <script src=\"script.js\" defer></script>\n   ```\n5. Save the HTML file.\n\n### Code Snippets and Commands\n- Example of using the `async` attribute:\n  ```html\n  <script src=\"script.js\" async></script>\n  ```\n\n- Example of using the `defer` attribute:\n  ```html\n  <script src=\"script.js\" defer></script>\n  ```\n\n### Troubleshooting and Common Issues\n- If multiple scripts have the `async` attribute, they will be executed in the order they finish loading, which may not be the order they appear in the HTML document.\n- If a script with the `defer` attribute depends on another script, make sure the dependent script is loaded first.\n\n### Best Practices and Recommendations\n- Use the `async` attribute for scripts that don't depend on other scripts or the DOM.\n- Use the `defer` attribute for scripts that need to be executed after the DOM has been parsed.\n- Avoid using both `async` and `defer` attributes on the same script.\n\n### Summary and Conclusion\nThe `async` and `defer` attributes in HTML5 provide options for loading and executing scripts asynchronously, improving the performance and loading time of web pages. By following the best practices and recommendations, you can optimize the usage of these attributes in your HTML files."
