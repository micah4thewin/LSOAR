This documentation will guide you through the process of displaying images using HTML5.\n\n### Objective and Scope\n\nThe objective of this documentation is to provide step-by-step instructions on how to display images on web pages using HTML5. The scope of this documentation includes the necessary requirements and pre-requisites, code snippets and commands, troubleshooting and common issues, as well as best practices and recommendations.\n\n### Requirements and Pre-requisites\n\nTo display images using HTML5, you will need the following:\n\n- A text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE)\n- An internet browser\n- Image files in a supported format (such as JPEG, PNG, or GIF)\n\n### Step-by-Step Instructions\n\nFollow these steps to display images using HTML5:\n\n1. Create a new HTML file or open an existing one in your text editor or IDE.\n2. Add the following code inside the `<body>` tag to display an image:\n\n   ```html\n   <img src=\"path/to/image.jpg\" alt=\"Image description\">\n   ```\n\n   Replace `path/to/image.jpg` with the actual path to your image file. You can also provide a description for the image by replacing `Image description` with your own description.\n\n3. Save the HTML file with a `.html` extension.\n4. Open the HTML file in your internet browser. You should now see the image displayed on the web page.\n\n### Code Snippets and Commands\n\nHere are some additional code snippets and commands that you may find useful when working with images in HTML5:\n\n- To set the width and height of an image, use the `width` and `height` attributes:\n\n  ```html\n  <img src=\"path/to/image.jpg\" alt=\"Image description\" width=\"200\" height=\"150\">\n  ```\n\n- To align an image, use the `align` attribute:\n\n  ```html\n  <img src=\"path/to/image.jpg\" alt=\"Image description\" align=\"left\">\n  ```\n\n- To add a caption to an image, wrap the `<img>` tag inside a `<figure>` tag and use the `<figcaption>` tag:\n\n  ```html\n  <figure>\n    <img src=\"path/to/image.jpg\" alt=\"Image description\">\n    <figcaption>Caption for the image</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n  ```\n\n### Troubleshooting and Common Issues\n\nIf the image is not displaying on the web page, check the following:\n\n- Ensure that the path to the image file is correct.\n- Make sure that the image file exists and is accessible.\n- Check the file extension of the image file and ensure that it is supported by HTML5.\n\n### Best Practices and Recommendations\n\nHere are some best practices and recommendations for displaying images using HTML5:\n\n- Optimize your images for web by compressing them to reduce file size.\n- Use descriptive alt text for images to improve accessibility.\n- Consider using responsive images to ensure proper display on different devices and screen sizes.\n\n### Summary and Conclusion\n\nIn this documentation, we have covered the process of displaying images using HTML5. We provided step-by-step instructions, code snippets, troubleshooting tips, and best practices. By following these guidelines, you can effectively display images on your web pages using HTML5."
