Two of these elements are the `<mark>` and `<progress>` elements. The `<mark>` element is used to highlight text within a document, while the `<progress>` element is used to represent the progress of a task or process. This article will provide a detailed guide on how to use these elements effectively.\n\n### Objective and Scope\nThe objective of this documentation is to explain the usage and implementation of the `<mark>` and `<progress>` elements in HTML5. It will cover the step-by-step instructions, code snippets, troubleshooting tips, best practices, and recommendations for using these elements.\n\n### Requirements and Pre-requisites\nTo follow along with the instructions in this documentation, you will need:\n- A text editor for writing HTML code\n- A web browser for viewing the HTML output\n\n### Step-by-Step Instructions\n\n#### Using the `<mark>` element\n1. Open your text editor and create a new HTML file.\n2. Add the following code to create a paragraph with highlighted text:\n```html\n<p>This is an example of <mark>highlighted text</mark>.</p>\n```\n3. Save the file with a .html extension.\n4. Open the HTML file in a web browser to see the highlighted text.\n\n#### Using the `<progress>` element\n1. Open your text editor and create a new HTML file.\n2. Add the following code to create a progress bar:\n```html\n<progress value=\"50\" max=\"100\"></progress>\n```\n3. Save the file with a .html extension.\n4. Open the HTML file in a web browser to see the progress bar.\n\n### Code Snippets and Commands\n- `<mark>` element code snippet:\n```html\n<p>This is an example of <mark>highlighted text</mark>.</p>\n```\n- `<progress>` element code snippet:\n```html\n<progress value=\"50\" max=\"100\"></progress>\n```\n\n### Troubleshooting and Common Issues\n- If the highlighted text or progress bar is not displaying correctly, make sure your HTML code is valid and properly structured.\n- Check that you have specified the correct values for the `<progress>` element's `value` and `max` attributes.\n\n### Best Practices and Recommendations\n- Use the `<mark>` element sparingly and only when necessary to avoid excessive highlighting.\n- When using the `<progress>` element, provide meaningful values for the `value` and `max` attributes to accurately represent the progress.\n\n### Summary and Conclusion\nThe `<mark>` and `<progress>` elements in HTML5 provide useful features for highlighting text and displaying progress. By following the step-by-step instructions and best practices outlined in this documentation, you can effectively use these elements in your web pages. Remember to troubleshoot any issues and follow the recommended practices for optimal results."
