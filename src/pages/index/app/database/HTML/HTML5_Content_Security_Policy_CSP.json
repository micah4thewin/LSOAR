It helps protect against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks and other types of code injection attacks by specifying the origins from which resources can be loaded.\n\n### Objective and Scope\nThe objective of this documentation is to provide a comprehensive guide on using HTML5 Content Security Policy (CSP) to enhance the security of web applications. The scope of this documentation includes understanding the basics of CSP, implementing CSP in HTML files, and configuring various directives to control resource loading.\n\n### Requirements and Pre-requisites\nTo follow this documentation, you need the following:\n\n- Basic knowledge of HTML5 and web development concepts\n- A text editor for editing HTML files\n- A modern web browser that supports CSP\n\n### Step-by-Step Instructions\n1. **Add the CSP meta tag**: To enable CSP on a web page, add the following meta tag inside the `<head>` section of the HTML file:\n\n   ```html\n   <meta http-equiv=\"Content-Security-Policy\" content=\"directive1 value1; directive2 value2; ...\">\n   ```\n\n   Replace `directive1 value1; directive2 value2; ...` with the desired directives and their values. For example, to allow scripts only from the same origin and stylesheets from a specific domain, use:\n\n   ```html\n   <meta http-equiv=\"Content-Security-Policy\" content=\"script-src 'self'; style-src example.com\">\n   ```\n\n2. **Specify directives**: CSP uses directives to control resource loading. Some commonly used directives include:\n   - `default-src`: Specifies the default sources for all resource types if not explicitly overridden by other directives.\n   - `script-src`: Specifies the sources from which scripts can be loaded and executed.\n   - `style-src`: Specifies the sources from which stylesheets can be loaded.\n   - `img-src`: Specifies the sources from which images can be loaded.\n   - `font-src`: Specifies the sources from which fonts can be loaded.\n\n   Use these directives along with their values to restrict resource loading based on your requirements.\n\n3. **Use nonce or hash values**: To allow specific inline scripts or styles, you can use nonce or hash values. Generate a unique nonce value or calculate the hash of the script or style content, and add it to the corresponding directive.\n\n   ```html\n   <script nonce=\"unique-nonce-value\">...</script>\n   <style nonce=\"unique-nonce-value\">...</style>\n   ```\n\n   Alternatively, you can use the `sha256` hash of the script or style content:\n\n   ```html\n   <script integrity=\"sha256-hash-value\">...</script>\n   <style integrity=\"sha256-hash-value\">...</style>\n   ```\n\n4. **Report violations**: To receive reports about CSP violations, you can specify a report URI using the `report-uri` directive. This allows you to monitor and analyze any attempted violations.\n\n   ```html\n   <meta http-equiv=\"Content-Security-Policy\" content=\"script-src 'self'; report-uri /csp-report-endpoint\">\n   ```\n\n   Replace `/csp-report-endpoint` with the URL of your report endpoint.\n\n### Code Snippets and Commands\n- To allow scripts only from the same origin and stylesheets from a specific domain:\n\n  ```html\n  <meta http-equiv=\"Content-Security-Policy\" content=\"script-src 'self'; style-src example.com\">\n  ```\n\n- To allow inline scripts with a nonce value:\n\n  ```html\n  <script nonce=\"unique-nonce-value\">...</script>\n  ```\n\n- To allow inline styles with a hash value:\n\n  ```html\n  <style integrity=\"sha256-hash-value\">...</style>\n  ```\n\n### Troubleshooting and Common Issues\n- **Mixed content errors**: If your web page contains both HTTP and HTTPS content, you may encounter mixed content errors. Ensure that all resources are loaded securely to avoid these errors.\n\n- **False positives**: CSP can sometimes block legitimate resources due to misconfiguration. Use the browser console to check for CSP violation errors and adjust your policy accordingly.\n\n### Best Practices and Recommendations\n- Start with a restrictive policy and gradually loosen it based on your application's requirements. This helps minimize the risk of potential security vulnerabilities.\n\n- Regularly monitor and analyze CSP violation reports to identify any attempted attacks or misconfigurations.\n\n- Test your CSP policy thoroughly on different browsers and platforms to ensure compatibility.\n\n### Summary and Conclusion\nHTML5 Content Security Policy (CSP) is a powerful tool for enhancing the security of web applications by controlling resource loading. By specifying the allowed sources for scripts, stylesheets, images, and other resources, CSP helps protect against code injection attacks. This documentation provided an overview of CSP, step-by-step instructions for implementation, troubleshooting tips, and best practices for optimal security."
