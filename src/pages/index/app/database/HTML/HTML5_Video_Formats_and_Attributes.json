  "article": "## HTML5 Video Formats and Attributes\n\n### Introduction\nHTML5 introduced the `<video>` element, which allows developers to embed videos directly into web pages without the need for third-party plugins like Adobe Flash. This article will explain the different video formats supported by HTML5 and the attributes that can be used to customize the video playback experience.\n\n### Objective and Scope\nThe objective of this documentation is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the video formats supported by HTML5 and the attributes that can be used to enhance the video playback. This documentation is intended for web developers who want to embed videos in their web pages using HTML5.\n\n### Requirements and Pre-requisites\nTo follow the instructions in this documentation, you will need:\n- A text editor to write HTML code.\n- A web browser that supports HTML5 video playback.\n\n### Step-by-Step Instructions\n1. Start by creating a new HTML file or open an existing one in your text editor.\n2. Add the `<video>` element to your HTML file. This is the container for your video. Here's an example:\n\n```html\n<video src=\"video.mp4\" controls></video>\n```\n\n3. Specify the video source using the `src` attribute. This should be the path to your video file. You can use relative or absolute paths.\n4. Add the `controls` attribute to enable the default video controls, such as play, pause, and volume.\n5. Save your HTML file and open it in a web browser. You should see the video player with the default controls.\n\n### Code Snippets and Commands\n- To specify multiple video sources for different formats, use the `<source>` element within the `<video>` element. Here's an example:\n\n```html\n<video controls>\n  <source src=\"video.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n  <source src=\"video.webm\" type=\"video/webm\">\n</video>\n```\n\n- To specify a fallback video source in case the browser doesn't support HTML5 video, use the `<object>` element within the `<video>` element. Here's an example:\n\n```html\n<video controls>\n  <source src=\"video.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n  <source src=\"video.webm\" type=\"video/webm\">\n  <object data=\"fallback-video.swf\">\n    <param name=\"movie\" value=\"fallback-video.swf\">\n  </object>\n</video>\n```\n\n### Troubleshooting and Common Issues\n- If the video is not playing, make sure the path to the video file is correct.\n- If the video is not displaying, check if the video format is supported by the browser.\n- If the video controls are not showing, ensure that the `controls` attribute is added to the `<video>` element.\n\n### Best Practices and Recommendations\n- Use multiple video sources in different formats to ensure compatibility across different browsers.\n- Provide a fallback video source or alternative content for browsers that do not support HTML5 video.\n- Optimize the video file size and format for faster loading and better performance.\n- Use the `poster` attribute to specify a preview image for the video.\n\n### Summary and Conclusion\nHTML5 provides a native way to embed videos in web pages using the `<video>` element. By specifying the video format and using attributes like `src` and `controls`, developers can create a customized video playback experience. Remember to test your videos in different browsers to ensure compatibility."
