Warm light (2700K-3000K) creates a cozy and intimate atmosphere, while cool light (4000K-5000K) can feel more energizing and vibrant. Experiment with different light temperatures to find the perfect balance for your romantic evenings.\n\n2. **Layering Lights**: Layering lights involves using a combination of ambient, task, and accent lighting to create depth and dimension in a room. For romantic evenings, consider using soft, diffused ambient lighting, task lighting for specific activities like reading or dining, and accent lighting to highlight focal points or create a romantic glow.\n\n3. **Dimming Controls**: Installing dimming controls allows you to adjust the brightness of your lights according to the desired ambiance.
